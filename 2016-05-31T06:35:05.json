Temperatures usually remain between 10\u00b0 to 22\u00b0 in autumn. The minimum temperature is around 6&nbsp;\u00b0C.\n*'''Summer''': The temperature in summer (from Mid-April to June-end) may rise to 44&nbsp;\u00b0C. The temperatures might sometime rise to 44&nbsp;\u00b0C in mid-June. Temperatures generally vary between 40 and 42&nbsp;\u00b0C. \n*'''Monsoon''': During monsoon (from early-July to mid-September), Chandigarh receives moderate to heavy rainfall and sometimes heavy to very heavy rainfall (generally during the month of August or September). Usually, the rain bearing monsoon winds blow from south-west/south-east.
