However, the city does not belong to either state. Rather, the city is administered by the federal government and hence classified as a [[union territory]]. '''Chandigarh''' is also the name of this union territory.\r\n\r\nChandigarh was a [[planned city]] until 1983, like [[Gandhinagar]], the capital of [[Gujarat]], until 1972.\r\n\r\nSeveral buildings in Chandigarh were designed by the Swiss [[architect]] [[Le Corbusier]] in the [[1950s]]. Le Corbusier was in fact the official architect of the city, which was commissioned by Jawaharlal Nehru, the first Prime Minister of independent India, to reflect the new nation's modern outlook and to look towards the future rather than towards the poverty and teeming, toiling masses, which everyone else was pointing towards.\r\n\r\n==External links==\r\n*http://chandigarh.nic.in/\r\n*http://www.pals.org/pec/chandigarh/chandigarh.html\r\n\r\n{{msg:India}}\r\n\r\n{{msg:stub}}"
