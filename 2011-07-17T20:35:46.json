Commissioned by [[Nehru]] to reflect the new nation's modern, progressive outlook, Chandigarh was designed by the [[French people|French]] (born [[Swiss]]) architect and urban planner, [[Le Corbusier]], in the 1950s.

Le Corbusier retained many of the seminal ideas of Mayer and Nowicki, like the basic framework of the master plan and its components: The Capitol, City Center, besides the University, Industrial area, and linear parkland. Even the neighborhood unit was retained as the basic module of planning. However, the curving outline of Mayer and Nowicki was reorganized into a mesh of rectangles, and the buildings were characterized by an \"honesty of materials\". Exposed brick and boulder stone masonry in its rough form produced unfinished concrete surfaces, in geometrical structures. This became the architectural form characteristic of Chandigarh, set amidst landscaped gardens and parks.\n\n[[image:Chandigarh Monument.jpg|thumb|The Open Hand Monument]]\n\n[[Chandigarh Museum and Art gallery]] have a separate section dedicated to the architecture of Chandigarh.\n\n==Chandigarh administration==\n{{See also|Chandigarh administration}}\n[[image:Corbu Chandigarh Palais Justice.JPG|thumb|Punjab and Haryana High Court at Chandigarh]]\nChandigarh Administration is under the control of the Administrator who is appointed under the provisions of Art 239 of the Constitution.
