Many existing towns in Punjab were surveyed as options for the new capital and dismissed for poor performance in relation to factors such as military defensibility and capacity for accommodating potential refugee influxes. The construction of a new town in Chandigarh was determined to be the best option due to its relative strength in these factors as well as its proximity to the national capital, New Delhi, its central location within the state of Punjab, its abundance of fecund land and its beautiful natural landscape.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://chandigarh.gov.in/knowchd_gen_historical.htm |title=Historical Background |work=Government of Chandigarh |accessdate=7 April 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519173408/http://http/ |archive-date=19 May 2011 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>\n\n===Modernism in new town design===\nOff the back of this conflation of assets Chandigarh then was well poised to serve a function as a city-building project in national identity.

Chandigarh is the first example of a state-funded master-planned [[modernisation theory|modernisation scheme]]. These \"urban utopias\" attempt to enforce nation-building policies through a federalised rule of law at a regional level, and diffuse a postcolonial urbanism which codes justice in its design.<ref name=\"urban utopias\">{{cite journal |last1=Datta|first1=Ayona|title=New urban utopias of postcolonial India: 'Entrepreneurial urbanization' in Dholera smart city, Gujarat|journal=Dialogues in Human Geography|volume=5|issue=1|pages=4|doi=10.1177/2043820614565748|url=http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/83074/3/__ds.leeds.ac.uk_staff_staff15_libmh_SCoReS_Repository_Datta_paper_sympletic%5B1%5D.pdf}}</ref> The intent is that the economic success and progressivism of cities such as Chandigarh as a lightning rod for social change would gradually be emulated at the scale of the nation. Chandigarh was for Nehru and Le Corbusier an embodiment of the egalitarian potential offered by [[modernism]], where the machine age would complete the liberation of the nation's citizens through the productive capacity of industrial technology and the relative ease of constructing civic facilities such as dams, hospitals, and schools; the very antithesis of the conservative and traditional legacy of colonialism.<ref name=\"National Identity\"/> Though built as a state capital Chandigarh came to be focused in industry and higher education.<ref name=\"Indian new towns\"/> The specialisation of these new towns in particular functions represents a crucial aspect of the modernisation process as a decolonising enterprise, in completing a national portfolio where each town forms a part of the utopian model for contemporary India.\n\nThe post-colonialism of Chandigarh is rooted in the transformation of the political ideals of those such as Nehru who generated a new Indian nationalism into the design of newly built forms.<ref name=\"postcolonial\">{{cite journal |last1=Shaw|first1=Annapurna|title=Town Planning in Postcolonial India, 1947-1965: Chandigarh Re-Examined|journal=Urban Geography|volume=30|issue=8|pages=864\u2013873|doi=10.2747/0272-3638.30.8.857|year=2009}}{{dead link|date=October 2019}}</ref> Scholars such as [[Edward Said]] have emphasised the sinister nature of nostalgia and the romanticisation of colonial architecture in newly independent colonies as artifacts that perpetuate the ideological legacy of the hegemony and replicate the hierarchy of power even after decolonisation.<ref name=\"decolonisation\">{{cite journal|last1=James-Chakraborty|first1=Kathleen|title=Beyond postcolonialism: New directions for the history of nonwestern architecture|url= |journal=Frontiers of Architectural Research|volume=3|issue=1|pages=2|doi=10.1016/j.foar.2013.10.001|year=2014|doi-access=free}}</ref> Insofar as modernism in architecture (which defined town planning under the Nehru era of rule) represents an active radical break from tradition and a colonial past even the very presence of Le Corbusier has been recognised as an indelible resistance to the British construction legacy, as he provided the first non-British influence on design thinking in India, enabling a generational shift in the contemporary cohort of architects and planners to be hired by the state throughout the rest of the century who were initiated under Modernist conditioning.<ref name=\"postcolonial\"/> As early as the 1950s the presence of the [[International Style (architecture)|International Style]] could be detected in the design of houses in India, \"whether [[mistri]] or architect designed\".<ref name=\"independent architecture\">{{cite book |last1=Lang|first1=Jon|last2=Desai|first2=Madhavi|last3=Desai|first3=Miki|date=1997|title=Architecture and Independence: The Search for Identity\u2014India 1880 to 1980|location=New York, NY|publisher=Oxford University Press, USA|page=213|isbn=978-0-195-63900-1}}</ref> The development of low-cost housing was a priority for Chandigarh, and the modern forms designed by Corbusier are characterised by a dispensing with colonial forms focused on classic aesthetics and a refocusing on strategies such as using narrow frontages and orientation for minimising direct exposure to the sun and maximising natural ventilation and efficient cost while providing modern amenities in the International Style aesthetic.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Jackson|first1=Iain|title=Maxwell Fry and Jane Drew's early housing and neighbourhood planning in Sector-22, Chandigarh|journal=Planning Perspectives|volume=28|issue=1|pages=12|doi=10.1080/02665433.2013.734993|year=2013}}</ref> These developments are credited as the beginning of a \"Chandigarh architecture\", inspiring a gradual experimentation with form and an \"Indianising\" of the International Style which precipitated the formation of the country's new cultural identity in town design.<ref name=\"postcolonial\"/>\n\n===Criticisms===\nCriticisms are well established of the implementation of the postcolonial vision of Nehru and Le Corbusier, and of the critical emphasis on its influence. Claims have been made that the focus on Corbusier's architect-centered discourse erases the plural authorship of the narrative of Chandigarh's development, arguing that it was, in fact, a hybridity of values and of \"contested modernities\" of Western and indigenous Indian origin and cultural exchanges rather than an uncontested administrative enterprise.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Perera|first1=Nihal|title=Contesting visions: hybridity, liminality, and authorship of the Chandigarh plan|journal=Planning Perspectives|volume=19|issue=2|pages=178|doi=10.1080/0266543042000192466|year=2004}}</ref> Such criticism is consistent with claims that decolonisation in India has marked a shift from segregation based on race to segregation based on class, and that planned cities are truly \"designed\" ones which represent the values and interests of a westernised middle-class Indian elite which ignore the complexities of India's diverse ethnic and cultural landscape and enabled neocolonial hierarchies such as the imposition of the Hindi language on non-conforming castes.<ref name=\"Making Chandigarh\"/><ref name=\"National Identity\"/><ref name=\"postcolonial\"/> Furthermore, the early over-saturation of the minimalist International Style on building design in Chandigarh has attracted criticisms of effecting a \"democratic, self-effacing banality\", though this criticism is perhaps negligent of how this was necessary in galvanising higher standards of urban living throughout the country.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Bhatt|first1=Vikram|last2=Scriver|first2=Peter|date=1990|title=Contemporary Indian Architecture: After the Masters.|location=Ahmedabad, India|publisher=Mapin|page=15|isbn=978-0-944-14219-6}}</ref>\n\n==Notable people from Chandigarh==\n<!---\u2666\u2666\u2666 Only add a person to this list if they already have their own article on the English Wikipedia \u2666\u2666\u2666---> \n<!---\u2666\u2666\u2666 Please keep the list in alphabetical order by LAST NAME \u2666\u2666\u2666---> \n{{Div col|colwidth=35em}}\n* [[Sarbjit Bahga]], architect, author, photo-artist\n* [[Binny Bansal]], founder of [[Flipkart]], Billionaire.<ref name=\"dnaindia.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/money/report-mukesh-ambani-india-s-richest-for-9th-year-flipkart-s-bansals-new-entrants-2128160|title=Mukesh Ambani India's richest for 9th year; Flipkart's Bansals new entrants -
