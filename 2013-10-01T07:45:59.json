The boundary of the state of [[Himachal Pradesh]] is also minutes away from its north border.\n\nChandigarh has a [[humid subtropical climate]] characterised by a seasonal rhythm: very hot summers, mild winters, unreliable rainfall and great variation in temperature (\u22121&nbsp;\u00b0C to 41.2&nbsp;\u00b0C). The average annual rainfall is [http://chandigarh.nic.in/knowchd_general.htm 1110.7 mm]. The city also receives occasional winter rains from the [[Western Disturbance]] originating over the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. Cold winds usually tend to come from the north near [[Shimla]], capital of Himanchal Pradesh and from the state of [[Jammu and Kashmir]], both of which receive their share of snowfall during wintertime.\n\n===Average temperature===\n\n*'''Spring''': The climate remains the most enjoyable part of the year during the spring season (from mid-February to mid-April). Temperatures vary between (max) 16&nbsp;\u00b0C to 25&nbsp;\u00b0C and (min) 9&nbsp;\u00b0C to 18&nbsp;\u00b0C.\n*'''Autumn''': In autumn (from Mid-September to mid November.), the temperature may rise to a maximum of 36&nbsp;\u00b0C. Temperatures usually remain between 16\u00b0 to 27\u00b0 in autumn. The minimum temperature is around 11&nbsp;\u00b0C.\n*'''Summer''': The temperature in summer (from Mid-May to Mid-June) may rise to a maximum of 45&nbsp;\u00b0C (rarely). Temperatures generally remain between 35&nbsp;\u00b0C to 40&nbsp;\u00b0C (94 \u2013 101F).\n*'''Monsoon''': During monsoon (from mid-June to mid-September), Chandigarh receives moderate to heavy rainfall and sometimes heavy to very heavy rainfall (generally during the month of August or September). Usually, the rain bearing monsoon winds blow from south-west/south-east. Mostly, the city receives heavy rain from south (which is mainly a persistent rain) but it generally receives most of its rain during monsoon either from North-west or North-east. Maximum amount of rain received by the city of Chandigrah during monsoon season is 195.5&nbsp;mm in a single day.\n*'''Winter''': Winters (November to Mid-March) are mild but it can sometimes get quite chilly in Chandigarh. Average temperatures in the winter remain at (max) 7&nbsp;\u00b0C to 15&nbsp;\u00b0C and (min) 0&nbsp;\u00b0C to 8&nbsp;\u00b0C.

[[Ashoka tree|Asoka]], [[Cassia Fistula|cassia]], [[mulberry]] and other trees flourish in the forested ecosystem. The city has forests surrounding it which sustain many animal and plant species. [[Deer]]s, [[Sambar (deer)|sambar]]s, [[barking deer]], parrots, [[woodpecker]]s and [[peacock]]s inhabit the protected forests. [[Sukhna Lake]] hosts a variety of ducks and geese, and attracts migratory birds from parts of Siberia and Japan in the winter season.\n\nA parrot sanctuary in the city is home to a variety of bird species.

The residential neighbourhoods are also organised according to an economic hierarchy with different types of housing for rich and poor.\n\nThis vision of Chandigarh, contained in the innumerable conceptual maps on the drawing board together with notes and sketches had to be translated into brick and mortar, was led by chief town planner Narinder S. Lamba and chief engineer appointed to the project, Ajit Gill. Le Corbusier retained many of the seminal ideas of Mayer and Nowicki, like the basic framework of the master plan and its components: [[Secretariat Building (Chandigarh)|The Capitol]], City Centre, besides the University, Industrial area, and linear parkland. Even the neighbourhood unit was retained as the basic module of planning. However, the curving outline of Mayer and Nowicki was reorganised into a mesh of rectangles, and the buildings were characterised by an \"honesty of materials\". Exposed brick and boulder stone masonry in its rough form produced unfinished concrete surfaces, in geometrical structures. This became the architectural form characteristic of Chandigarh, set amidst landscaped gardens and parks.\n\nThe [[Chandigarh Museum and Art Gallery]] has a separate section dedicated to the architecture of Chandigarh.\n\n==Chandigarh administration==\nChandigarh administration is under the control of the administrator who is appointed under the provisions of Article 239 of the Constitution of India.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}.
