CONSIDER ADDING MATERIAL TO THE 'HISTORY OF INDIA' ARTICLE.-->\n{{main|History of India}}\n\n[[Stone Age]] rock shelters with paintings at [[Bhimbetka]] in the state of [[Madhya Pradesh]] are the earliest known traces of human life in India. The first known permanent settlements appeared over 9,000 years ago and gradually developed into the [[Indus Valley Civilization]], dating back to 3300 BCE in western India. It was followed by the [[Vedic Civilization]] which laid the foundations of [[Hinduism]] and other cultural aspects of early Indian society. From around 550 BCE, many independent kingdoms and republics known as the [[Mahajanapadas]] were established across the country laying the foundations of ancient India. \n\nThe empire built by the [[Maurya dynasty]] under Emperor [[Ashoka|Ashoka the Great]] united most of modern [[South Asia|Southern Asia]] except the [[Dravidian people|Dravidian]] kingdoms in the south. From 180 BCE, a series of invasions from [[Central Asia]] followed including the [[Indo-Greek]]s, [[Indo-Scythian]]s, [[Indo-Parthian]]s and [[Kushan Empire|Kushans]] in the north-western [[Indian Subcontinent]]. From the third century CE, the [[Gupta Empire|Gupta dynasty]] oversaw the period referred to as ancient India's \"Golden Age.\" While the north had larger, fewer kingdoms, in the south there were several dynasties such as the [[Chalukyas]], [[Rashtrakutas]], [[Hoysalas]], [[Cheras]], [[Cholas]], [[Pallavas]] and [[Pandyas]] in different times and regions.\nThe political influence of these mighty southern kingdoms, though felt to a lesser extent by north India, extended into [[Southeast Asia]] and [[Sri Lanka]] and deeply influenced their culture. The southern kingdoms remained relatively more stable and carried out maritime trade in spices and precious gems with the Arabia, China and Europe from ancient times. \n[[Ancient Indian science and technology|Science, engineering]], [[Indian art|art]], [[Indian literature|literature]], [[Indian Mathematics|mathematics]], [[Indian science|astronomy]], [[Religion in India|religion]] and [[Indian philosophy|philosophy]] flourished under the patronage of these kings.\n[[Image:Sanchi2.jpg|thumb|left|270px|The [[Sanchi|Sanchi stupa]] in Sanchi, [[Madhya Pradesh]] built by emperor Ashoka in the 3rd century BC]]\nFollowing the invasions from Central Asia, between the tenth to the twelfth centuries, much of north India came under the rule of the [[Delhi Sultanate]], and later the [[Mughal dynasty]], who gradually expanded their reign through most of the Indian subcontinent. Nevertheless, several indigenous kingdoms flourished, especially in the south, such as the [[Vijayanagara Empire]]. From the sixteenth century onwards, several [[Eur"
