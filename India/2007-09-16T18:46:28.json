State politics have been dominated by several national parties including the INC, the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP), the [[Communist Party of India]] (CPI), and various regional parties. From 1950 to 1990, the INC enjoyed a parliamentary majority barring two brief periods. The INC was out of power between 1977 and 1980, when the [[Janata Party]] won the election owing to public discontent with the [[Indian Emergency (1975\u20131977)|\"Emergency\"]] declared by the then Prime Minister [[Indira Gandhi]]. In 1989, a [[Janata Dal]] led [[National Front (India)|National Front]] coalition in alliance with the [[Left Front]] coalition won the elections but managed to stay in power for only two years.\n\nThe years 1996\u20131998 were a period of turmoil in the federal government with several short-lived alliances holding sway. The BJP formed a government briefly in 1996, followed by the [[United Front (India)|United Front]] coalition. In 1998, the BJP formed the [[National Democratic Alliance (India)|National Democratic Alliance]] (NDA) with several regional parties and became the first non-Congress government to complete a full five-year term. In the [[Indian general elections, 2004|2004 Indian elections]], the INC won the largest number of Lok Sabha seats and formed a government with a coalition called the [[United Progressive Alliance]] (UPA), supported by various left-leaning parties and members opposed to the BJP.\n\n==Foreign relations and the military==\n{{main|Foreign relations of India|Indian Armed Forces}}\n[[Image:Agni.jpg|thumb|The Nuclear capable [[Agni missile system|Agni-II ballistic missile]] during a [[Republic Day Parade|Republic Day parade]].]]\nSince independence in 1947, India has maintained cordial relationships with most nations.

The [[Indian vernacular architecture|vernacular architecture]] displays notable regional variation.\n\n[[Music of India|Indian music]] is highly diversified. [[Indian classical music|Classical music]] is mainly split between the [[North India]]n [[Hindustani classical music|Hindustani]] and [[South India]]n [[Carnatic music|Carnatic]] traditions. Highly regionalised forms of popular music include [[filmi music|filmi]] and [[Indian folk music|folk music]] like [[bhangra]]. Many [[Indian classical dance|classical dance forms]] exist, including [[bharatanatyam]], [[kathakali]], [[kathak]], [[kuchipudi]], [[Manipuri dance|manipuri]], [[odissi]] and [[yakshagana]]. They often have a narrative form and are usually infused with devotional and spiritual elements.\n\nThe earliest [[Indian literature|literary traditions]] in India were mostly oral and were only later transcribed. Most of these are represented by religious texts such as the [[Vedas]], the [[Mahabharata]], and the [[Ramayana]]; [[Sangam]] literature from Tamil Nadu is among India's oldest. Among many notable Indian writers of the modern era, using both Indian languages and [[Indian Writing in English|English]], [[Rabindranath Tagore]] is perhaps the most famous.\n[[Image:Toda Hut.JPG|left|thumb|An oval-roofed hut{{dubious}} of the [[Toda people]] of the [[Nilgiris district|Nilgiris]].

Popular styles of dress include the [[sari]] for women and the [[lungi]] or [[dhoti]] for men.\n\nIndia's national sport is [[field hockey]], even though [[cricket]] is the most popular sport. In some states, particularly those in the [[North-East India|northeast]] and the coastal states of West Bengal, Goa, and Kerala, [[football (soccer)|football]] is also a popular sport. In recent times, [[tennis]] has also gained popularity. [[Chess]], commonly held to have [[Origins of chess#India|originated]] in India, is also gaining popularity with the rise of the number of recognized Indian [[International Grandmaster|grandmasters]]. Traditional sports include [[kabaddi]], [[kho-kho]], and [[gilli-danda]], which are played nationwide. India is home to the age-old discipline of [[yoga]] and to the ancient [[Indian martial arts|martial arts]], [[Kalarippayattu]] and [[Varma Kalai]].\n\n[[Public holidays in India|Indian festivals]] come in a vast variety; many are celebrated irrespective of caste and creed. The most popular holidays are [[Diwali]], [[Holi]], [[Onam]], [[Vijayadashami|Dussehra]], [[Bihu]], [[Durga puja]], the two [[Eid]]s, [[Christmas]], [[Ugadi]], and [[Vaisakhi]]. India has three [[national holidays]]. Other sets of holidays, varying between nine and twelve, are officially observed in the individual states. Religious practices are an integral part of everyday life and are a very public affair. Traditional Indian family values are highly respected, although urban families now prefer a nuclear family system due to the socio-economic constraints imposed by the traditional joint family system.\n{{seealso|Music of India|Cinema of India|Indian literature|Indian cuisine|Sports in India|Public holidays in India}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Indian topics}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n{{IndicText}}\n{{portal|India|Flag of India.svg}}\n{{spoken Wikipedia|India.ogg|2006-03-07}}\n{{sisterlinks|India}}\n\n; Government\n* [http://india.gov.in/ Official entry portal] of the Government of India\n* [http://www.nic.in Official directory] of Indian Government websites\n\n; General reference\n* {{CIA World Factbook link|in|India}}\n* [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]] entry on [http://www.britannica.com/nations/India India]\n* [[BBC News|BBC]] country profile of [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/country_profiles/1154019.stm India]\n* [[Library of Congress Country Studies]] entry on [http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/intoc.html India]\n\n; Other\n* {{wikitravel|India}}\n{{wikimapia|20632784|83671875|4|India}}\n{{wikiatlas|India}}\n* {{dmoz|Regional/Asia/India/|India}}\n\n<!--===========================({{NoMoreLinks}})===============================-->\n<!--| DO NOT ADD MORE LINKS TO THIS ARTICLE.
