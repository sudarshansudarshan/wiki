CONSIDER ADDING MATERIAL TO THE 'HISTORY OF INDIA' ARTICLE.-->\n{{main|History of India}}\n\n[[Stone Age]] rock shelters with paintings at [[Bhimbetka]] in [[Madhya Pradesh]] are the earliest known traces of human life on the [[Indian subcontinent]]. The first known permanent settlements appeared over 9,000 years ago, and gradually developed into the [[Indus Valley Civilization]], dating back to 3300 BCE. It was followed by the [[Vedic Civilization]] which laid the foundations of [[Hinduism]] and other cultural aspects of early Indian society. From around 550 BCE, many independent kingdoms and republics known as the [[Mahajanapadas]] were established across the country. \n\nThe empire built by the [[Maurya dynasty]] under Emperor [[Ashoka]] united most of modern [[South Asia]] except the kingdoms in the south. From 180 BCE, a series of invasions from [[Central Asia]] followed including the [[Indo-Greek]]s, [[Indo-Scythian]]s, [[Indo-Parthian]]s and [[Kushan Empire|Kushans]] in the northwestern [[Indian Subcontinent]]. From the third century CE, the [[Gupta|Gupta dynasty]] oversaw the period referred to as ancient India's \"Golden Age.\" While the north had larger, fewer kingdoms, in the south there were several dynasties such as the [[Chalukyas]], [[Cholas]], [[Pallavas]] and [[Pandyas]], overlapping in time and space. [[Ancient Indian science and technology|Science, engineering]], [[Indian art|art]], [[Indian literature|literature]], [[Indian science|astronomy]], and [[Indian philosophy|philosophy]] flourished under the patronage of these kings.\n\n[[Image:Indischer version3.jpg|thumb|left|Paintings at the Ajanta Caves in western India, 6th century AD.]]\nFollowing the invasions from [[Central Asia]], between the tenth to the twelfth centuries, much of north India came under the rule of the [[Delhi Sultanate]], and later the [[Mughal dynasty]], who gradually expanded their reign through large parts of the Indian subcontinent. Nevertheless, several indigenous kingdoms flourished, especially in the south, like the [[Vijayanagara Empire]]. In the seventeenth and eighteenth century, the [[Mughal]] supremacy declined and the [[Maratha Empire]] became the dominant power. From the sixteenth century onwards, several [[Europe|European]] countries, including [[Portugal]], [[Netherlands]], [[France]] and the [[United Kingdom]], started arriving as traders, later taking advantage of the fractious nature of relations between the kingdoms, to establish [[colony|colonies]] in the country. By 1856, most of India came under control of the [[British East India Company]]. A year later, a nationwide insurrection of rebelling military units and kingdoms, known locally as the [[Indian rebellion of 1857|First War of Indian Independence]] (known as the Sepoy Mutiny elsewhere) broke out, which failed even as it seriously challenged British rule. As a consequence, India came under the direct control of the [[British Crown]] as a [[British Raj|colony of the British Empire]].\n\n[[Image:Nehru Gandhi 1937 touchup.jpg|thumb|[[Mahatma Gandhi]] (right) with India's first prime minister, [[Jawaharlal Nehru]]]]\nFrom early twentieth century, the [[Indian Independence Movement]] of the [[Indian National Congress]] steadily gained widespread support, largely led by [[Mahatma Gandhi]]. Millions of protesters would engage in mass campaigns of [[civil disobedience]] with a commitment to ''[[ahimsa]]'' or non-violence. Finally, on [[15 August]], [[1947]], India gained independence from British rule not before losing its Muslim-majority areas which were carved out into a separate [[nation-state]] of Pakistan. Three years later, on [[26 January]], [[1950]], India chose to be a republic, and a new [[Constitution of India|Constitution]] came into effect.\n\nSince independence, India has seen sectarian violence and [[insurgency|insurgencies]] in various parts of the country, but has maintained its unity and democracy. It has unresolved territorial disputes with China, which escalated into the brief [[Sino-Indian War]] in 1962; and with Pakistan, which resulted in wars in [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1947|1947]], [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965|1965]], [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971|1971]] and in 1999 in [[Kargil War|Kargil]]. India is a founding member of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] and the [[United Nations]] (as part of British India). In 1974, India conducted an underground [[Smiling Buddha|nuclear test]]. This was followed by [[Operation Shakti|five more]] tests in 1998. Significant economic reforms beginning in 1991 have transformed India into one of the fastest-growing economies and [[India as an emerging superpower|an emerging superpower]] in the world, and added to its global and regional clout.\n\n==Government==\n{{main|Government of India}}\n{{Indian symbols}}\n\nThe Constitution of India declares India to be a [[sovereignty|sovereign]], [[socialism|socialist]], [[secularism|secular]], [[liberal democracy|democratic]] [[republic]]. India has a federal form of government and a [[bicameralism|bicameral]] [[parliament]] operating under a [[Westminster System|Westminster-style]] parliamentary system. It has three branches of governance: the [[Legislature]], [[Executive]], and [[Judiciary]].\n\nThe [[President of India|President]] is the [[head of state]]; his role in governance is largely ceremonial. The President is elected indirectly by an [[electoral college]] for five-year terms. The [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Minister]] is the de facto [[head of government]] and holds most executive powers. He or she is appointed by the President, with the requirement that he or she enjoys the support of the party or coalition securing the majority of seats in the lower house of Parliament.\n\nThe legislature of India is the bicameral [[Indian Parliament|Parliament]], which consists of the upper house called the [[Rajya Sabha]] (Council of States), and the lower house called the [[Lok Sabha]] (House of People). The 245-member Rajya Sabha is chosen indirectly by the state legislative assemblies; members have staggered six-year terms. Each state sends members to the Rajya Sabha proportionate to its population. The Lok Sabha's 545 members are directly elected by popular vote for five-year terms, and is the determinative constituent of political power and government formation. All [[Indian nationality law|Indian citizens]] above age 18 are eligible to vote; voting is not mandatory.<ref name=\"manorama\">{{cite book | first = K.M. | last = Matthew | title = Manorama Yearbook 2003 | publisher = [[Malayala Manorama]] | year = 2006 | id = ISBN 81-89004-07-7 | pages = pg 524 }}</ref>\n\nThe executive branch consists of the President, Vice-President, and the [[Council of Ministers]] (the [[Cabinet]] being its executive committee) headed by the Prime Minister. Any minister holding a portfolio must be a member of either house of parliament.

The party enjoyed a parliamentary majority barring two brief periods during the 1970s and late 1980s. This rule was interrupted between 1977 to 1980, when the [[Janata Party]] coalition won the election owing to public discontent with the [[Indian Emergency (1975-1977)|\"Emergency\"]] declared by the then Prime Minister [[Indira Gandhi]]. The [[Janata Dal]] won elections in 1989, but its government managed to hold on to power for only two years. Between 1996 and 1998, there was a period of political flux with the government being formed first by the [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] nationalist [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] followed by a left-leaning [[United Front (India)|United Front]] coalition. In 1998, the BJP formed the [[National Democratic Alliance (India)|National Democratic Alliance]] (NDA) with smaller regional parties, and became the first non-Congress and coalition government to complete a full five-year term. The [[Indian general elections, 2004|2004 Indian elections]] saw the Congress party winning the largest number of seats to form a government leading the [[United Progressive Alliance]], supported by left-leaning and other parties opposed to the BJP.\n\n==Military and foreign relations==\n{{main|Military of India|Foreign relations of India}}\n\nSince independence, India has maintained cordial relationships with most nations. It took a leading role in the 1950s by advocating the independence of European colonies in Africa and Asia. During the [[Cold War]], India tried to maintain its neutrality and was one of the founding members of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]]. After the [[Sino-Indian War]] and the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965]], India's relationship with the [[Soviet Union]] warmed at the expense of ties with the [[United States]] and continued to remain so until the end of the Cold War. Despite criticism and military sanctions, India has consistently refused to sign the [[CTBT]] and the [[NPT]], preferring instead to maintain sovereignty over its nuclear program. Recent overtures by the Indian government have strengthened relations with the United States, China, and Pakistan. In the economic sphere, India has close relationships with other developing nations in [[South America]], [[Asia]], and [[Africa]]. In recent years, India has played an influential role in the [[ASEAN]], [[SAARC]], and the [[WTO]]. India has been a long time supporter of the [[United Nations]], with over 55,000 [[Indian Armed Forces|Indian military]] and police personnel having served in 35 UN peace keeping operations deployed across four continents.<ref name=\"UN\">{{cite web | title = India and the United Nations | url = http://www.un.int/india/india_and_the_un_pkeeping.html | accessdate = April 22 | accessyear = 2006}}</ref>\n\nIndia maintains the third largest military force in the world. The [[Military of India|armed forces of India]] consists of the [[Indian Army]], [[Indian Air Force]] and the [[Indian Navy]]. There are auxillary forces like the [[Indian Paramilitary Forces]], the [[Indian Coast Guard]] and the [[Strategic Forces Command]]. India is a declared nuclear weapons nation. The Indian Army maintains the second largest active troops in the world. The Indian Navy is the fifth largest in terms of manpower and the Indian Air Force is the fourth largest in the world. The [[President of India]] is the supreme commander of the Indian armed forces.\n\n==States and territories==\n{{main|States and territories of India}}\n\nIndia is divided into twenty-nine states and six federally-governed [[union territories]]. All states and the union territory of Pondichery have elected governments. The remaining four union territories have centrally-appointed administrators. All states and union territories are subdivided into districts. In larger states, districts may be grouped together to form a division.\n\n{{India states}}\n\n==Geography==\n{{main|Geography of India}}\n[[Image:India topo big.jpg|thumb|Elevated regions in India]] \nIndia constitutes the major portion of the [[Indian subcontinent]], which sits atop the [[Indian Plate]] and the northwesterly portion of the [[Indo-Australian Plate]]. India's northern and northeastern states are partially situated in the [[Himalayas|Himalayan Range]]. The rest of northern, central, and eastern India consists of the fertile [[Indo-Gangetic Plain]]. In the west, bordering southeastern [[Pakistan]], lies the [[Thar Desert]]. Southern India is almost entirely composed of the peninsular [[Deccan|Deccan plateau]], which is flanked by two hilly coastal ranges, the [[Western Ghats]] and the [[Eastern Ghats]].\n\nIndia is home to several major rivers, including the [[Ganges River|Ganges]], the [[Brahmaputra River|Brahmaputra]], the [[Yamuna]], the [[Godavari River|Godavari]], the [[Kaveri River|Kaveri]], the [[Narmada River|Narmada]], and the [[Krishna River|Krishna]]. India has three archipelagos &mdash; [[Lakshadweep]], which lies off the southwestern coast; the volcanic [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands]] island chain to the southeast, and the [[Sunderbans]] in the [[Ganges Delta]] of West Bengal.\n\nThe climate in India varies from [[tropical climate|tropical]] in the south to more [[temperate climate|temperate]] in the Himalayan north, where elevated regions receive sustained winter snowfall. India's climate is strongly influenced by the Himalayas and the Thar Desert. The Himalayas, along with the [[Hindu Kush]] mountains in Pakistan, prevent cold Central Asian [[katabatic wind]]s from blowing in. This keeps the bulk of the Indian subcontinent warmer than most locations at similar latitudes. The Thar Desert is responsible for attracting the moisture-laden [[Monsoon#Southwest Summer Monsoon|summer monsoon]] winds that, between June and September, provide most of India's rainfall.\n\n== Flora and fauna ==\n{{main|Fauna of India|Flora of India}}\n[[Image:Trachypithecus-geei-cropped.jpg|thumb|right|Now the world's rarest monkey, the [[Gee's Golden Langur|golden langur]] typifies the precarious survival of much of India's megafauna.]]<!--[[Image:Panthera tigris cropped.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Bengal Tiger|Bengal tiger]].]]-->\n\nIndia, lying within the [[Indomalaya ecozone]], hosts significant [[biodiversity]]; it is home to 7.6% of all [[mammal]]ian, 12.6% of [[birds|avian]], 6.2% of [[reptile|reptilian]], and 6.0% of [[flowering plant]] species.<ref name=unep>Indira Gandhi Conservation Monitoring Centre (IGCMC), New Delhi and the [http://www.unep-wcmc.org/ United Nations Environmental Program (UNEP), World Conservation Monitoring Center], Cambridge, UK.  2001.

However, since 1991, India has gradually opened up its markets through [[liberalization|economic reforms]] by reducing government controls on foreign trade and investment. [[Privatization|Privatisation]] of publicly-owned industries and the opening of certain sectors to private and foreign participation has continued amid political debate.\n\nWith a [[Gross Domestic Product|GDP]] growth rate of 9.2%, the Indian economy is among the fastest growing in the world.<ref>[http://bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&sid=ayAK98NMbmCA&refer=home India's Economic Growth Unexpectedly Quickens to 9.2%]</ref> It is the world's [[List of countries by GDP (PPP)|fourth largest]] as measured by [[purchasing power parity]] (PPP), with a GDP of US$3.63 trillion.

The service sector accounts for 23% of GDP; the agricultural and industrial sectors make up 22% and 17% respectively. Major agricultural crops include rice, wheat, oilseed, cotton, jute, tea, sugarcane, and potatoes. Major industries include textiles, chemicals, food processing, steel, transportation equipment, cement, mining, petroleum, and machinery.<ref name=\"CIA\"/> More recently, India has capitalised on its large pool of educated, English-speaking people to become an important [[Business process outsourcing in India|outsourcing]] destination for multinational corporations. India has also become a major exporter of software as well as financial, research, and technology services.

Many Indian cultural practices, languages, customs, and monuments are examples of this co-mingling over centuries. Famous monuments, such as the [[Taj Mahal]] and other examples of [[Islamic architecture|Islamic-inspired architecture]], have been inherited from the Mughal dynasty. These are the result of traditions that combined elements from all parts of the country.\n\n[[Music of India|Indian music]] is highly diversified. [[Indian classical music|Classical music]] is mainly split between the [[North India]]n [[Hindustani classical music|Hindustani]] and [[South India]]n [[Carnatic music|Carnatic]] traditions. Highly regionalised forms of popular music include [[Filmi music|Filmi]] and [[Indian folk music|folk music]] like [[Bhangra]]. Many [[Indian classical dance|classical dance forms]] exist, including [[Bharatanatyam]], [[Kathakali]], [[Kathak]], [[Kuchipudi]], [[Manipuri dance|Manipuri]], [[Odissi]] and [[Yakshagana]]. They often have a narrative form and are usually infused with devotional and spiritual elements. The earliest [[Indian literature|literary traditions]] in India were mostly oral, and were only later transcribed. Most of these are represented by religious texts such as the [[Vedas]], the [[Mahabharata]], and the [[Ramayana]]; [[Sangam]] literature from Tamil Nadu is among India's oldest. The many notable Indian writers of the modern era, using both Indian languages and [[Indian Writing in English|in English]], include [[Rabindranath Tagore]]. The [[Cinema of India|Indian film industry]] is the world's most prolific; its most recognisable face is the Mumbai-based \"[[Bollywood]]\", which produces mainly Hindi films. Other strong cinema industries are based on the [[Cinema of Karnataka|Kannada]], [[Malayalam cinema|Malayalam]], [[Tamil cinema|Tamil]], [[Tollywood|Telugu]], and [[Bengali cinema|Bengali]] languages.\n\n[[Image:Toda Hut.JPG|thumb|A [[Toda people|Toda]] tribal hut.]]\nThe [[cuisine of India]] is extremely diverse, as ingredients, spices and cooking methods vary from region to region. [[Rice]] and [[wheat]] are the nation's main staple foods. The country is notable for its wide variety of [[vegetarian]] and non-vegetarian [[wikibooks:Cookbook:Cuisine of India|cuisine]]. Spicy food and sweets are popular in India. Traditional [[Indian dress]] greatly varies across the regions in its colours and styles, and depend on various factors, including climate. Popular styles of dress include the [[sari]] for women and the [[lungi]] or [[dhoti]] for men.\n\nIndia's national sport is [[field hockey]], although [[cricket]] is now the ''de facto'' national game. In some states, particularly those in the northeast, [[football (soccer)|football]] is the most popular sport and is widely followed. In recent times, [[tennis]] has gained popularity. [[Chess]], commonly held to have originated in India, is also gaining popularity with the rise of the number of recognised Indian [[International Grandmaster|grandmasters]]. Traditional sports include [[kabaddi]], [[kho kho]], and [[gilli-danda]], which are played nationwide.\n\n[[Holidays in India|Indian festivals]] come in a large variety; many are celebrated irrespective of caste and creed. The most popular are [[Diwali]], [[Holi]], [[Sankranti]]/[[Pongal]], [[Gudi Padwa]]/[[Ugadi]], the two [[Eid]]s, [[Christmas]], and [[Vaisakhi]]. India has three national holidays. Other sets of holidays, varying between nine and twelve, are officially observed in the individual states. Religious practices are an integral part of everyday life and are a very public affair. Traditional Indian family values are highly respected, although urban families now prefer a nuclear family system due to the socio-economic constraints imposed by the traditional joint family system.\n\n==See also==\n{{Indian topics}}\n\n==References==\n<div class=\"references-small\" style=\"-moz-column-count:2; column-count:2;\">\n<references/>\n</div>\n\n==External links==\n{{Spoken Wikipedia|India.ogg|2006-03-07}}\n{{sisterlinks|India}}\n{{portal|India|Emblem of India.svg}}\n; '''Government''' \n* [http://india.gov.in/ Official entry portal] of the Government of India\n* [http://www.nic.in Official directory] of Indian goverment websites\n; '''General references'''\n* {{CIA_World_Factbook_link|in|India}}\n* [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]] entry on [http://www.britannica.com/nations/India India]\n* [[BBC News|BBC]] country profile of [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/country_profiles/1154019.stm India]\n; Satellite images\n* [http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=india&ie=UTF8&om=1&z=4&ll=21.125829,82.759987&spn=37.992658,88.59375&t=h Satellite images of India] from [[Google Maps]]\n{{wikimapia|20632784|83671875|4|India}}\n; '''Other'''\n* {{wikitravel|India}}\n* {{dmoz|/Regional/Asia/India/|India}}\n\n<!-- ==============================({{NoMoreLinks}})============================== -->\n<!-- DO NOT ADD MORE LINKS TO THIS ARTICLE.
