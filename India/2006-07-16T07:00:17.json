CONSIDER ADDING MATERIAL TO THE 'HISTORY OF INDIA' ARTICLE.-->\n{{main|History of India}}\n\n[[Stone Age]] rock shelters with paintings at [[Bhimbetka]] in the state of [[Madhya Pradesh]] are the earliest known traces of human life in India. The first known permanent settlements appeared over 9,000 years ago, and gradually developed into the [[Indus Valley Civilization]], dating back to 3300 BCE in western India. It was followed by the [[Vedic Civilization]] which laid the foundations of [[Hinduism]] and other cultural aspects of early Indian society. From around 550 BCE, many independent kingdoms and republics known as the [[Mahajanapadas]] were established across the country. \n\nThe empire built by the [[Maurya dynasty]] under Emperor [[Ashoka]] united most of modern [[South Asia]] except the [[Tamil]] kingdoms in the south. From 180 BCE, a series of invasions from [[Central Asia]] followed including the [[Indo-Greek]]s, [[Indo-Scythian]]s, [[Indo-Parthian]]s and [[Kushan Empire|Kushans]] in the north-western [[Indian Subcontinent]]. From the third century CE, the [[Gupta|Gupta dynasty]] oversaw the period referred to as ancient India's \"Golden Age.\" While the north had larger, fewer kingdoms, in the south there were several dynasties such as the [[Chalukyas]], [[Rashtrakutas]], [[Hoysalas]], [[Cheras]], [[Cholas]], [[Pallavas]] and [[Pandyas]], overlapping in time and space. [[Ancient Indian science and technology|Science, engineering]], [[Indian art|art]], [[Indian literature|literature]], [[Indian Mathematics|mathematics]], [[Indian science|astronomy]], [[Religion in India|religion]] and [[Indian philosophy|philosophy]] flourished under the patronage of these kings.\n[[Image:Sanchi2.jpg|thumb|left|270px|The [[Sanchi|Sanchi stupa]] in Sanchi, [[Madhya Pradesh]] built by emperor Ashoka in the 3rd century BC]]\nFollowing the invasions from Central Asia, between the tenth to the twelfth centuries, much of north India came under the rule of the [[Delhi Sultanate]], and later the [[Mughal dynasty]], who gradually expanded their reign through large parts of the Indian subcontinent. Nevertheless, several indigenous kingdoms flourished, especially in the south, like the [[Vijayanagara Empire]]. From the sixteenth century onwards, several [[Europe|European]] countries, including [[Portugal]], [[Netherlands]], [[France]] and the [[United Kingdom]], started arriving as traders, later taking advantage of the fractious nature of relations between the kingdoms, to establish [[colony|colonies]] in the country. By 1856, most of India came under control of the [[British East India Company]]. A year later, a nationwide insurrection of rebelling military units and kingdoms, known locally as the [[Indian rebellion of 1857|First War of Indian Independence]] (known as the Sepoy Mutiny elsewhere) broke out, which failed even as it seriously challenged British rule. India thus came under the direct control of the [[British Crown]] as a colony of the British Empire.\n\n[[Image:Nehru Gandhi 1937 touchup.jpg|thumb|270px|right|[[Mahatma Gandhi]] (right) with India's first Prime Minister, Pandit [[Jawaharlal Nehru]]]]\nIn the early twentieth century, a nationwide [[Indian Independence Movement|struggle for independence]] was launched by the [[Indian National Congress]], and various revolutionary groups. The movement was largely led by [[Mahatma Gandhi]] and during [[Second World War]] by the Japanese backed [[Indian National Army]] led by [[Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose]]. Millions of protestors would engage in mass campaigns of [[civil disobedience]] with a commitment to ''[[ahimsa]]'' or non-violence. Finally, on [[15 August]], 1947, India gained independence from British rule. Three years later, on [[26 January]], 1950, India chose to be a republic, and a new [[Constitution of India|Constitution]] came into effect.\n\nSince independence, India has seen sectarian violence and [[insurgency|insurgencies]] in various parts of the country, but has maintained its unity and democracy. It has unresolved territorial disputes with China, which escalated into the brief [[Sino-Indian War]] in 1962; and with Pakistan, which resulted in wars in [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1947|1947]], [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965|1965]], [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971|1971]] and in 1999 in [[Kargil War|Kargil]]. India is a founding member of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] and the [[United Nations]] (as part of British India). In 1974, India conducted an underground [[Smiling Buddha|nuclear test]]. This was followed by [[Operation Shakti|five more]] tests in 1998. Significant economic reforms beginning in 1991 have transformed India into one of the fastest-growing economies in the world, adding to its growing global and regional influence.\n{{see also|Military history of India|Timeline of Indian history}}\n\n==Government==\n{{main|Government of India}}\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 0.75em; margin-bottom: 0.5em; padding: 0.5em; width:220px; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\"\n|+ '''National symbols of India'''\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left: 1em;\" | '''Flag'''\n| [[Tiranga]]                                                \n|-\n| style=\"padding-left: 1em;\" | '''Emblem'''\n| [[Emblem of India|Sarnath Lion]]\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left: 1em;\" | '''Anthem'''\n| \"[[Jana Gana Mana]]\"\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left: 1em;\" | '''Song'''\n| \"[[Vande Mataram|Vand\u0113 M\u0101taram]]\"\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left: 1em;\" | '''Animal'''\n| [[Bengal Tiger|Royal Bengal Tiger]]\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left: 1em;\" | '''Bird'''\n| [[Indian Peacock]]\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left: 1em;\" | '''Flower'''\n| [[Nelumbo nucifera|Lotus]]\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left: 1em;\" | '''Tree'''\n| [[Banyan]]\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left: 1em;\" | '''Fruit'''\n| [[Mango]]\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left: 1em;\" | '''Sport'''\n| [[Field Hockey]]\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left: 1em;\" | '''Calendar'''\n| [[Indian National Calendar|Saka]]\n|\n|}\nIndia is referred to as the largest democracy in the world, by virtue of the fact that it has the largest [[electorate|electing population]] among [[List of democratic states|democratic countries]].  The country has a federal form of government and a [[bicameral]] [[parliament]] operating under a [[Westminster System|Westminster-style]] parliamentary system. It has three branches of governance: the [[Legislature]], [[Executive]] and [[Judiciary]].  The [[President of India|President]] is the [[head of state]], though he has a largely ceremonial role to play. He is also the Supreme Commander of [[Indian military|India's armed forces]]. The President is elected indirectly by an [[electoral college]] for five-year terms. Presidential assent is needed for a Bill or Ordinance passed by the Parliament to come into force. The [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Minister]] is the de facto [[head of government]], and has most executive powers. He or she is appointed by the President, with the requirement that he or she enjoy the support of the majority of the party or coalition securing the most seats in the lower house of the Parliament. The Union Council of Ministers headed by the Prime Minister aids and advices the President on governance matters.\n[[Image:Thesouthblockdelhi.JPG|270px|thumb|The [[Secretariat Building]] in New Delhi houses the [[Indian Prime Minister's Office|Prime Minister's Office]], the ministries of [[Ministry of Defence|Defence]], External Affairs and Finance and the Home Ministry.]]\nThe legislature of India is the bicameral [[Indian Parliament|Parliament]], which consists of the upper house called the [[Rajya Sabha]] (Council of States), and the lower house called the [[Lok Sabha]] (House of People). The 245-member Rajya Sabha is chosen indirectly through the state Legislative Assemblies, and has a staggered six-year term. Each state sends members to the Rajya Sabha in a proportion of its population. The 545-member Lok Sabha is directly elected (Some seats are reserved for Casted based system) by popular vote for a five-year term (except two nominated Anglo-Indian members), and is the determinative constituent of political power and government formation. Universal adulthood suffrage is guaranteed by the Constitution for citizens above 18 years of age.  \nThe executive arm consists of the President, Vice-President, and the [[Council of Ministers]] (the [[Cabinet]] being its executive committee) headed by the Prime Minister. Any minister holding a portfolio must be a member of either house of parliament. In the Indian parliamentary system, the executive is subordinate to the legislature.  \n\nIndia's independent judiciary consists of the [[Supreme Court of India|Supreme Court]], headed by the [[Chief Justice of India]]. The Supreme Court has both original jurisdiction over disputes between states and the Centre, and appellate jurisdiction over the eighteen [[High Courts of India]], and additionally, the power to declare Union and state laws null and void if in conflict with the Constitution.<ref name=\"manorama\">{{cite book | first = K.M. | last = Matthew | title = Manorama Yearbook 2003 | publisher = Malaya Manorama | year = 2006 | id = ISBN 8189004077 | pages = pg 524 }}</ref>\n\n==Politics==\n{{main2|Politics of India|Foreign relations of India}}\n[[image:IndiaMap2.PNG|thumb|270px|Map of India <ref name=\"loc\">The black line is the boundary as recognised by the government of India.

The boundary separating India and Pakistan is known as the [[Line of Control]], that separating India and China as the '[[Line of Actual Control]]'. Most of the state of [[Arunachal Pradesh]] is still claimed by China.</ref>.]]\nFor most of its independent history, India has been ruled by the [[Indian National Congress]]. The party enjoyed a parliamentary majority barring two brief periods during the 1970s and late 1980s. This rule was interrupted between 1977 to 1980, when the [[Janata Party]] coalition won the election owing to public discontent with the [[Indian Emergency|\"Emergency\"]] declared by the then Prime Minister [[Indira Gandhi]]. The [[Janata Dal]] won elections in 1989, but its government managed to hold on to power for only two years. Between 1996 and 1998, there was a period of political flux with the government being formed first by the right-of-centre, nationalist [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP) followed by a left-leaning [[United Front (India)|United Front]] coalition. In 1998, the BJP formed the [[National Democratic Alliance]] (NDA) with smaller regional parties, and became the first non-Congress and coalition government to complete a full five-year term. The [[Indian general elections, 2004|2004 Indian elections]] saw the left-leaning Congress party winning the largest number of seats to form a government by leading the [[United Progressive Alliance]], and supported by communist parties and those opposed to the BJP.\n\nSince independence, India has maintained cordial relationships with most nations. It took a lead in the 1950s in advocating the independence of European colonies in Africa and Asia. During the [[Cold War]], India tried to maintain its neutrality and was one of the founding members of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]]. After the [[Sino-Indian War]] and the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965]], India's relationship with the [[Soviet Union]] warmed at the expense of ties with the [[United States]] and continued to remain so till the end of the Cold War. India has consistently refused to sign the [[CTBT]] and the [[NPT]] to maintain sovereignty over its nuclear program despite criticism and military sanctions. Recent overtures by the Indian government have strengthened India's relations with United States, China and Pakistan. In the economic sphere, India has close relationships with other developing nations of [[South America]], [[Asia]] and [[Africa]]. In recent years, India has played an influential role in the [[SAARC]]. India has been a long time supporter of the [[United Nations]], with over 55,000 [[Indian Armed Forces|Indian military]] and police personnel having served in 35 UN peace keeping operations over four continents <ref name=\"UN\">{{cite web | title = India and the United Nations | url = http://www.un.int/india/india_and_the_un_pkeeping.html | accessdate = April 22 | accessyear = 2006}}</ref>. Since the 1990s, India has been considered a [[great power|great or major power]] on the global stage, meaning it has considerable influence on international affairs. The status of [[emerging superpower]] has also improved relations with the [[United States]], as some political observers believe the United States will support India's growth in order to counter [[People's Republic of China|China's]] authoritarian regime. <ref> [http://www.io.com/~casburn/blog/archives/2004/01/04/000051.html The Trailing Edge] ''India as a future superpower'' </ref>\n\n==States and union territories==\n{{main|States and territories of India}}\n\nIndia is divided into twenty-eight states (which are further subdivided into [[districts of India|districts]]), and seven [[union territories]] (or territories owned by the Central Government). All states and the union territories of Delhi and Pondicherry have elected governments. The remaining five union territories have centrally-appointed administrators. The states and territories are further divided into 602 districts.\n\n''See also: [[Districts of India]], [[List of Indian districts]]''\n\n{{India states}}\n\n==Geography==\n{{main|Geography of India}}\n[[Image:Yumthanghimalayas.jpg|thumb|270px|The [[Himalaya]]s stretch from [[Jammu and Kashmir]] in the north to [[Arunachal Pradesh]] in the far east making up most of India's northern borders]]\nThe territory of India constitutes a major portion of the [[Indian subcontinent]], situated on the [[Indian Plate]], the northerly portion of the [[Indo-Australian Plate]], in [[southern Asia]]. India's northern and northeastern states are partially situated in the [[Himalaya|Himalayan Mountain Range]]. The rest of northern, central and eastern India consists of the fertile [[Indo-Gangetic plain]]. In the west, bordering southeast [[Pakistan]], lies the [[Thar Desert]]. The [[South India|southern Indian]] [[Peninsula]] is almost entirely composed of the [[Deccan|Deccan plateau]], which is flanked by two hilly coastal ranges, the [[Western Ghats]] and [[Eastern Ghats]].\n\nIndia is home to several major rivers, including the [[Ganges|Ganga]], [[Brahmaputra]], [[Yamuna]], [[Godavari]], [[Kaveri]], [[Narmada]], and [[Krishna River|Krishna]]. India has three archipelagos &ndash; [[Lakshadweep]] off the southwest coast, the [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands]] volcanic island chain to the southeast, and the [[Sunderbans]] in the Gangetic delta in West Bengal.\n\nClimate in India varies from [[tropical climate|tropical]] in the south to more [[temperate climate|temperate]] in the Himalayan north, with elevated regions in the north receiving sustained snowfall in winters. India's climate is strongly influenced by the Himalayas and the Thar Desert. The Himalayas, along with the [[Hindu Kush]] mountains in Pakistan, provide a barrier to the cold winds from Central Asia. This keeps most of the Indian subcontinent warmer than most locations in similar latitudes. The [[Thar Desert]] is responsible for attracting the moisture laden [[southwest monsoon]] winds that provide most of India's rainfall between June and September.\n\n{{see also|Climate of India|Ecoregions of India|Geology of India}}\n\n==Economy==\n{{main|Economy of India}}\nThe economy of India is the [[List of countries by GDP (PPP)|fourth largest]] in the world as measured by [[purchasing power parity]] (PPP), with a [[Gross Domestic Product|GDP]] of US $3.63 [[trillion]].

Popular forms of music also prevail, the most notable being [[Filmi music]]. In addition to this are the diverse traditions of [[Indian folk music|folk music]] from different parts of the country. Many [[Indian classical dance|classical dance forms]] exist, including the [[Bharatanatyam]], [[Kathakali]], [[Kathak]], [[Kuchipudi]], and [[Manipuri dance|Manipuri]]. They often have a narrative form and are usually infused with devotional and spiritual elements. \n\nThe earliest [[Indian literature|literary traditions]] in India were mostly oral, and were later transcribed. Most of these are represented by sacred works like the [[Vedas]] and the epics of the [[Mahabharata]] and [[Ramayana]]. [[Sangam]] literature from Tamil Nadu represents some of India's oldest traditions. There have been many notable modern Indian writers, both in Indian languages and [[Indian Writing in English|in English]]. India's only [[Nobel Prize for Literature|Nobel laureate in literature]] was the [[Bengali language|Bengali]] writer [[Rabindranath Tagore]]. India is the third largest newspaper market in Asia with an estimated circulation of at least 66 million copies daily in 2003.\n\nThe nation also produces the world's largest number of [[Cinema of India|motion pictures]] every year. The most recognisable face is that of cinema production based in Mumbai, which produces mainly commercial Hindi films, often referred to as \"[[Bollywood]]\". There are also strong cinema industries based on the [[Malayalam language|Malayalam]] [[Kannada language|Kannada]] [[Tamil language|Tamil]] and [[Telugu language|Telugu]] languages.\n\nThere were five [[Miss World]] winners from India, which has the highest number of winners in Miss World as of 2005. \n[[Image:Babasteve-View_of_Varanasi_from_the_Ganges.jpg|thumb|270px|right|[[Varanasi]], the religious and cultural center of India for thousands of years is the oldest living city in the world and is considered as one of the most sacred places of [[pilgrimage]] for [[Hindus]] irrespective of denomination.<ref name=Varanasicity>[http://www.highbeam.com/doc.aspx?DOCID=1P1:79293885&num=4&ctrlInfo=Round20%3AMode20b%3ADocG%3AResult&ao=&FreePremium=BOTH \"Oldest Holy city\"]</ref>]]\n\nReligious practices of various faiths are an integral part of everyday life in society. Religion in India is a very public affair, with many practices imbued with pomp and vitality accompanying their underlying spiritual qualities. Education is highly regarded by members of every socio-economic stratum. Traditional Indian family values are highly respected, and considered sacred, although urban families have grown to prefer a nuclear family system, owing to the socio-economic constraints imposed by the traditional [[joint family]] system.\n\nThe [[cuisine of India]] is  diverse, as ingredients, spices and cooking methods vary from region to region. Rice and wheat are the staple foods in the country. The country is notable for its wide variety of [[vegetarian]] and non-vegetarian [[wikibooks:Cookbook:Cuisine of India|cuisine]]. Spicy food and sweets are popular in India. [[Indian Dress|Traditional dress]] in India greatly varies across the regions in its colours and styles, and depend on various factors, including climate. Popular styles of dress include the traditional [[sari]] for women and the traditional [[dhoti]] for men.\n\nIndia's national sport is [[field hockey]], although [[cricket]] is now the ''de facto'' national game. In some states, particularly in the northeast, [[football (soccer)]] is the most popular sport and is widely watched. In recent times, [[tennis]] has gained popularity in India. [[Chess]] is also gaining popularity with the rise of the number of recognised [[grandmasters]]. The most commonly held view is that chess originated in India. Traditional indigenous sports include [[kabaddi]]<ref name=\"rediff\">{{cite web | title = India pitches for Olympic kabbadi | work = Rediff.com | url = http://www.rediff.com/sports/2000/aug/30india.htm | accessdate = April 15 | accessyear = 2006}}</ref>, [[Kho Kho]] and [[gilli-danda]], which are played in most parts of the country.\n\n==Holidays==\n\n{{main|List of Festivals in India}}\nIndia is also known as a land of festivals. A melting pot of many religions, India has a rich diversity of [[Indian festivals|festivals]], many of which are celebrated irrespective of caste and creed. The most widely known and popular celebrations include the Hindu festivals of [[Diwali]], [[Holi]], [[Pongal]] and [[Dussehra]] and the Muslim celebration of [[Eid]].\n\nA number of festivals are common to most parts of India; however, they may be called by different names in the various parts of the country or may be celebrated in a different fashion and style. India has three National Holidays. Other sets of holidays, varying from nine to twelve, pertain to festivals, religious holidays and births of leaders which are legislated by the individual states.\n\n<center>\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"3\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"70%\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse; border:1px solid #aaa; text-align:left\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#efefef;\" width=\"15%\" | Date\n! style=\"background:#efefef;\" width=\"25%\" | Holiday\n! style=\"background:#efefef;\" | Remarks\n|-\n| [[26 January]]\n| [[Republic Day of India|Republic Day]]\n| The Constitution of India came into effect on this day in 1950.\n|-\n| [[15 August]]\n| [[Independence Day (India)|Independence Day]]\n| India gained its independence from the British Empire on this day in 1947.\n|-\n| [[2 October]]\n| [[Gandhi Jayanti]]\n| The Birth Date of [[Mahatma Gandhi]].\n|-\n|-\n|}\n</center>\n\n==See also==\n{{Topics related to India}}\n{{India ties}}\n\n==References==\n{{Spoken Wikipedia|India.ogg|2006-03-07}}\n<div style=\"font-size: 95%\">\n<references/>\n</div>\n\n==External links==\n{{portal}}\n{{sisterlinks|India}}\n<!--PLEASE ADD SITES RELATING TO INDIA AS A WHOLE.

Pictured is the city's famous \"Priest King\" statue.]]\nThe modern state of Pakistan was established on [[August 14]] 1947, but the region has an extensive ancient history that overlaps with the histories of [[Ancient India]], [[Iran]] and [[Afghanistan]]. The region was a crossroads of historic trade routes, including the [[Silk Road]], and was settled over thousands of years by many groups including [[Dravidians]], [[Indo-Aryans]], [[Persians]], [[Greeks]], [[Scythians]], [[Parthians]] [[Kushans]], [[White Huns]], [[Afghans]], [[Turkic peoples|Turks]], [[Mongols]] and [[Arab]]s. Historian and geographer de Blij Muller characterized quite aptly while describing the historical embodiment of the land when he said, \"If, as is so often said, [[Egypt]] is the gift of the [[Nile]], then Pakistan is the gift of the [[Indus]].\" The earliest evidence of humans is pebble tools of the [[Soan Culture]]<ref name=\"soan\">[http://www.shef.ac.uk/archaeology/research/pakistan University of Sheffield's archaeological research in Pakistan]</ref> in the [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]] province between 500,000 to 100,000 years ago. The [[Indus River|Indus region]] was the site of several ancient cultures including [[Mehrgarh]], one of the world's earliest known towns, and the [[Indus Valley Civilisation]] at [[Harrappa]] and [[Mohenjo-Daro]].<ref name=\"indus_valley\">[http://www.mnsu.edu/emuseum/archaeology/sites/middle_east/mohenjo_daro.html Minnesota State University page on Mohenjo-Daro]</ref> The Indus Valley Civilisation collapsed in the middle of the second millennium BCE and was followed by the [[Vedic Civilisation]] which extended over much of northern India and Pakistan. Successive empires and kingdoms ruled the region from the [[Achaemenid]] Persian empire<ref name=\"achaemenid\">[http://www.livius.org/aa-ac/achaemenians/achaemenians.html Livius.org on the extent of the Achaemenid Empire]</ref> around 543 BCE, to [[Alexander the Great]]<ref name=\"plutarch\">[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Alexander*/8.html#ref98 Plutarch's ''Life of Alexander'']</ref> in 326 BCE and the [[Mauryan]] empire. The [[Indo-Greek Kingdom]] founded by [[Demetrius I of Bactria|Demetrius of Bactria]] included [[Gandhara]] and [[Punjab region|Punjab]] from 184 BCE, and reached its greatest extent under [[Menander I|Menander]],  establishing the [[Greco-Buddhism|Greco-Buddhist]] period with advances in trade and culture. The city of [[Taxila]] (Takshashila) became a major centre of learning prior to the arrival of Islam - the ruins may still be seen within the [[Swat Valley]], to the west of [[Islamabad]].\n\nIn 712 [[Common Era|CE]], the Arab general [[Muhammad bin Qasim]]<ref name=\"qasim\">[http://www.infinityfoundation.com/ECITChachnamaframeset.htm Infinity Foundation's translation of the Chach-Nama]</ref> conquered [[Sindh]] and [[Multan]] in southern [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]], setting the stage for several successive Muslim empires including the [[Ghaznavid Empire]], the [[Muhammad of Ghor|Ghorid]] Kingdom, the [[Delhi Sultanate]] and the [[Mughal Empire]]. During this period [[Sufi]] missionaries played a pivotal role in converting a majority of the regional population to [[Islam]]. The gradual decline of the Mughal Empire in the early eighteenth century provided opportunities for the [[People of Afghanistan|Afghans]], [[Balochis]] and [[Sikhs]] to exercise control over large areas until the [[British East India Company]]<ref name=\"east_india\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/pktoc.html Library of Congress study of Pakistan]</ref> gained ascendancy over South Asia. \n[[Image:Badshahi Mosque July 1 2005 pic32 by Ali Imran.jpg|thumb|200px|[[seventeenth century|17th Century]] [[Badshahi Masjid]] built by [[Mughal]] emperor [[Aurangzeb]] in [[Lahore]] ]]\nThe 1857 [[Indian War of Independence|War of Independence]] was the region's last major armed struggle against the British, but it laid the foundations for the generally unarmed freedom struggle led by the [[Indian National Congress|Congress]]. However the [[All India Muslim League|Muslim League]] rose to popularity in the late 1930's amid fears of under-representation and neglect of Muslims in politics.

The [[secular]] policies of the past were replaced by Zia's introduction of the Islamic [[Shariat]] legal code, and increased religious influences on the civil service and the military. [[Muhammad Khan Junejo]] was elected in 1985 as [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Prime Minister]], but with the death of General Zia in a plane crash in 1988, [[Benazir Bhutto]], daughter of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, was elected as the first female Prime Minister of Pakistan.

The Muslim League's leadership of Pakistani politics reduced significantly with the rise of other political parties, with the [[Pakistan People's Party]] in West Pakistan, and the [[Awami League]] in East Pakistan, which would ultimately lead to the creation of Bangladesh. The first [[Constitution of Pakistan]] was adopted in 1956, but was suspended in 1958 by [[Ayub Khan]]. The Constitution of 1973, suspended in 1977 by [[Zia-ul-Haq]], was re-instated in 1991 and is the country's most important document, laying the foundations of government. Pakistan is a [[federal republic]] with [[Islam]] as the state religion. The [[semi-presidential system]] includes a [[bicameral]] legislature consisting of a 100-member [[Senate of Pakistan|Senate]] and a 342-member [[National Assembly of Pakistan|National Assembly]]. The [[President of Pakistan|President]] is the [[Head of State]] and the [[Commander in Chief]] of the Armed Forces and is elected by an [[Electoral College of Pakistan|electoral college]]. The [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|prime minister]] is usually the leader of the largest party in the National Assembly. Each province has a similar system of government with a directly elected Provincial Assembly in which the leader of the largest party or alliance becomes Chief Minister. Provincial Governors are selected by the Provincial Assemblies on the advice of the Chief Minister. \n[[Image:ParliamentHouse.jpg|thumb|200px|Parliament house in [[Islamabad]]]]\n\nThe [[Military of Pakistan|Pakistani military]] has played an influential role in mainstream politics throughout Pakistan's history, with military presidents ruling from 1958&ndash;71, 1977&ndash;88 and from 1999 onwards. The leftist Pakistan People's Party (PPP), led by [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]], emerged as a major political player during the 1970s. Under the military rule of Zia-ul-Haq, Pakistan began a marked shift from the British-era secular politics and policies, to the adoption of [[Shariat]] and other laws based on Islam. During the 1980s, the anti-[[feudal]], pro-[[Muhajir Urdu|Muhajir]] [[Muttahida Qaumi Movement]] (MQM) was started by unorthodox and educated urban dwellers of [[Sindh]] and particularly [[Karachi]]. The 1990s were characterized by coalition politics dominated by the PPP and a rejuvenated Muslim League. \n\nIn the October 2002 general elections, the [[Pakistan Muslim League (Q)]] (PML-Q) won a [[plurality]] of National Assembly seats with the second-largest group being the [[Pakistan Peoples Party|Pakistan People's Party Parliamentarians]] (PPPP), a sub-party of the PPP. [[Zafarullah Khan Jamali]] of PML-Q emerged as Prime Minister but resigned on [[June 26]], [[2004]] and was replaced by PML-Q leader [[Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain]] as interim Prime Minister. On [[August 28]], [[2004]] the National Assembly voted 191 to 151 to elect the [[Finance Minister of Pakistan|Finance Minister]] and former [[Citibank]] Vice President [[Shaukat Aziz]] as Prime Minister. [[Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal]], a coalition of Islamic religious parties, won elections in [[North-West Frontier Province]], and increased their representation in the [[National Assembly of Pakistan|National Assembly]].\n\n[[Image:Ambuj Saxena Wikipedia User Profile.jpg|thumb|200px|Ambuj Saxena was the first Indian to have carnal knowledge of a virgin daughter of Pakistan, free of charge.

Pakistan is also a member of the major regional organisations of the [[South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation]] (SAARC) and the [[Economic Cooperation Organisation]] (ECO). In the past, Pakistan has had mixed relations with the United States especially in the early 1950s when Pakistan was the United States' \"most allied ally in Asia\"<ref name=\"mostallied\">[http://www.fpa.org/newsletter_info2583/newsletter_info_sub_list.htm?section=Pakistan%3A%20The%20Most%20Allied%20Ally%20in%20Asia Pakistan: The Most Allied Ally in Asia]</ref> and a member of both the [[Central Treaty Organisation]] (CENTO) and the [[Southeast Asia Treaty Organisation]] (SEATO). During the Soviet-Afghan war in the 1980s Pakistan was a crucial US ally, but relations soured in the 1990s, when sanctions were applied by the US over suspicions of Pakistan's nuclear activities. The [[September 11 attacks]] and the subsequent [[War on Terrorism]] have seen an improvement in US&ndash;Pakistan ties, especially after Pakistan ended its support of the [[Taliban]] regime in [[Kabul]]. In January 2004, founder of Pakistani nuclear program [[A. Q. Khan]] confessed of nuclear proliferation to [[Libya]], [[Iran]] and [[North Korea]]. On [[February 5]], [[2004]], the president [[Pervez Musharraf]], announced that he had pardoned A. Q. Khan.\n\nPakistan has long had troubled relations with [[Relations between India and Pakistan|neighbouring India]]. The long-running dispute over [[Kashmir]] resulted in full fledged wars in [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1947|1947]] and [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965|1965]]. Civil war in 1971 flared into the simultaneous [[Bangladeshi Liberation War]] and the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]]. Pakistan conducted nuclear weapon tests in 1998 to counterbalance India's [[Pokhran-II|nuclear tests]] and became the only muslim [[declared nuclear states|nuclear weapons state]]. The relations with India are steadily improving following peace initiatives in 2002. Pakistan maintains close [[economic]], [[military]] and [[political]] relationships with the [[People's Republic of China]]. Pakistan also faces instability in the [[Federally Administered Tribal Areas]], where the tribal leaders support the Taliban; Pakistan has had to deploy its army in these regions to suppress the local unrest; although a recently declared ceasefire between the tribal leaders and the Pakistani government will bring back the much needed stability to the region.<ref name=\"local_unrest\">[http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2005%5C12%5C31%5Cstory_31-12-2005_pg7_29 'Taliban' gain sway in tribal region]. <u>Daily Times</u>.

In 2001 the federal government abolished the third tier of government ([[Divisions of Pakistan|administrative divisions]]) in favour of the former fourth tier districts. The provinces and the capital territory are subdivided into a total of [[Districts of Pakistan|107 districts]] which contain numerous [[tehsils]] and local governments.

There are an estimated 108 peaks above 7,000&nbsp;metres (23,000&nbsp;ft) high that are covered in snow and [[glaciers]]. Five of the mountains in Pakistan (including [[K2]] and [[Nanga Parbat]]) are over 8,000&nbsp;metres (26,000&nbsp;ft). Linking [[India]]n-controlled Kashmir to the [[Northern Areas|Northern Areas of Pakistan]] and running the length of the country is the [[Indus River]] with its many tributaries. To the west of the Indus are the dry, hilly deserts of [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]]; to the east are the rolling sand dunes of the [[Thar Desert]]. Most areas of Punjab and parts of Sindh are fertile plains where agriculture is of great importance.\n\nThe climate varies as much as the scenery with cold winters and hot summers in the north and a mild climate in the south, moderated by the influence of the ocean. The central parts have extremely hot summers with temperatures rising to 45&nbsp;\u00baC (113&nbsp;\u00baF), followed by very cold winters, often falling below freezing. There is very little rainfall ranging from less than 250&nbsp;millimetres to more than 1,250&nbsp;millimetres (9.8&ndash;49.2&nbsp;in), mostly brought by the unreliable south-westerly [[monsoon]] winds during the late summer. Water shortages have been eased by the construction of dams on the rivers and the drilling of water wells in many drier areas.\n\n== Flora and fauna ==\n[[Image:Hunza by jayzee.jpg|thumb|200px|The [[Hunza Valley|Hunza]] valley in northern Pakistan. &mdash; Agricultural and scenic]]\nThe wide variety of landscapes and climates in Pakistan allows for a wide variety of wild animals and birds. The forests range from [[coniferous]] [[alpine]] and [[subalpine]] trees such as spruce, pine, and [[deodar cedar]] in the northern mountains to [[deciduous]] trees such as the mulberry-type Shisham in the Sulaiman range in the south. The western hills have [[juniper]] and [[tamarisk]] as well as coarse grasses and scrub plants. Along the coast are [[mangrove]] forests which form much of the coastal wetlands.\n\nIn the south, there are crocodiles in the murky waters at the mouth of the Indus River whilst on the banks of the river, there are boars, deer, [[porcupine]]s, and small rodents. In the sandy scrublands of central Pakistan are found jackals, hyenas, wild cats, panthers, and leopards while the clear blue skies abound with hawks, falcons, and eagles. In the southwestern deserts are rare Asiatic cheetahs. In the northern mountains are a variety of endangered animals including [[Marco Polo sheep]], [[Urial|Urial sheep]], [[Markhor]] and [[Ibex]] goats, [[Asiatic black bear|black]] and [[Brown bear|brown]] Himalayan bears, and the very rare [[Snow Leopard]]. Another rare species is the blind [[Indus River Dolphin]] of which there are believed to be about 1,000 remaining, protected in two major sanctuaries. In recent years the number of wild animals being killed for fur and leather trading led to a new law banning the hunting of wild animals and birds and the establishment of several wildlife sanctuaries and game reserves.<ref name=\"wildlife\">[http://www.wildlifeofpakistan.com/wildlifesanctuarygamereservesmap.htm Wildlife Sanctuaries of Pakistan]</ref>\n\n== Economy ==\n{{main|Economy of Pakistan}}\n[[Image:KarachiFinancial.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Karachi]] is the financial capital of Pakistan.]] \nPakistan is a [[developing country]] which has faced a number of challenges on both political and economic fronts.

There has been a great improvement in the [[foreign exchange]] position and a rapid growth in [[hard currency]] reserves in recent years. The 2005 estimate of foreign debt was close to US$40 billion. However, this has decreased in recent years with assistance from the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) and debt-relief from the United States.<ref name=\"cia_world_factbook\" /> Pakistan's [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) in 2005 was estimated at US$385.2 billion and its [[per capita]] GDP was US$2,400.

In 2001, the country's GDP growth rate was at 1.8%, but in the fiscal year that ended [[June 30]], [[2005]], the nominal GDP growth rate peaked at 8.4%.

As of 2005, over three million refugees (approximately 81.5% being ethnic [[Pashtuns]]) remain in Pakistan as a result of the wars in [[Afghanistan]], according to the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]], with 83% of the refugees reporting their intent to permanently settle in Pakistan.<ref name=\"afghan refugees census\">[http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/home/opendoc.pdf?tbl=SUBSITES&page=SUBSITES&id=434fdc702 UNHCR Statistical Summary Report: Census of Afghans in Pakistan]</ref>\n\n== Society and culture ==\n{{main|Culture of Pakistan}}\n[[Image:Faisal masjid isla galleryfull.jpeg|thumb|200px|[[King Faisal Mosque]] in [[Islamabad]], one of the largest in the world]]\n[[Image:Shalamar Garden July 14 2005-South wall pavilion with fountains.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Shalimar Gardens (Lahore)|Shalimar Gardens]] of [[Lahore]]]]\n\nPakistan has a rich and unique culture that has preserved established traditions throughout history. Prior to the arrival of Islam, many Punjabis and Sindhis were Hindu and Buddhist but this changed during the expansion of Islam by the [[Ummayad]] General [[Muhammad bin Qasim]], [[Mahmud of Ghazni]] and others. Many cultural practices, foods, monuments, and shrines were inherited from the rule of Muslim [[Mughal]] and [[People of Afghanistan|Afghan]] emperors including the national dress of [[shalwar kameez|Shalwar Qameez]]. Women wear brightly coloured Shalwar Qameez, while men often wear solid-coloured Shalwar Qameez, usually with a [[sherwani]] or [[achkan]] (long coat) that goes over the Shalwar Qameez.\n\nThe rich variety of [[Music of Pakistan|Pakistani music]] ranges from diverse provincial folk music and traditional styles such as [[Qawwali]] and [[Ghazal|Ghazal Gayaki]] to modern forms fusing traditional and western music, such as the synchronisation of Qawwali and western music by the renowned [[Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan]]. Other major [[Ghazal]] singers include [[Mehdi Hassan]], [[Ghulam Ali]], [[Farida Khanum]], [[Tahira Syed]], [[Abida Parveen]] and [[Iqbal Bano]]. The arrival of [[Afghanistan|Afghan]] refugees in the western provinces has rekindled [[Pashto]] and [[Persians|Persian]] music and established [[Peshawar]] as a hub for Afghan musicians and a distribution centre for Afghan music abroad. Until the 1990s, the state-owned [[Pakistan Television Corporation]] (PTV) and [[Pakistan Broadcasting Corporation]] were the dominant media outlets, but there are now numerous [[List of Pakistani TV and radio Channels|private television channels]] such as [[Geo TV]], [[Indus News|Indus TV]], [[Hum TV|Hum]] and [[ARY Group|ARY]] with a strong focus on plays or soap operas - some of them critically acclaimed. Various American, European, and Asian television channels and movies are available to a majority of the Pakistani population via [[cable TV|cable]] and [[satellite television]]. There are also small indigenous movie industries based in Lahore and Peshawar (often referred to as [[Lollywood]] and [[Pollywood]]). Although [[Bollywood]] movies are banned, Indian film stars are popular in Pakistan.\n\nPakistani society is largely [[multilingual]] and predominantly [[Muslim]], with high regard for traditional family values, although urban families have grown into a [[nuclear family]] system due to the socio-economic constraints imposed by the traditional [[joint family]] system.

The northern parts of Pakistan have many old fortresses, towers and other architecture as well as the [[Hunza Valley|Hunza]] and [[Chitral]] valleys, the latter being home to the small pre-Islamic [[animist]] [[Kalasha]] community who claim descent from the army of [[Alexander the Great]]. [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]] is the site of Alexander's [[battle of the Hydaspes River|battle]] on the [[Jhelum River]] and the historic city [[Lahore]], Pakistan's cultural capital with many examples of [[Mughal]] architecture such as the [[Badshahi Masjid]] and the [[Shalimar Gardens (Lahore)|Shalimar Gardens]].\n\n== Holidays ==\n{{main|Holidays in Pakistan}}\n[[Image:Hazuri_Bagh.JPG|thumb|200px|[[Mughal Empire|Mughal-era]] [[Hazuri Bagh]] in [[Lahore]], an example of Mughal era Islamic architecture.]]\nThere are many holidays and festivals celebrated annually in Pakistan. While Pakistan is an Islamic nation, there are also several secular holidays including Pakistan Day ([[March 23]]), Independence Day ([[August 14]]), Defence of Pakistan Day ([[September 6]]), Pakistan Air Force Day ([[September 7]]), the anniversaries of the birth ([[December 25]]) and death ([[September 11]]) of [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah|Quaid-e-Azam]], [[Allama Iqbal]] ([[November 9]]) and the birth ([[July 30]]) and death ([[July 8]]) of [[Fatimah Jinnah|Madar-e-Millat]]. [[Labour Day]] (also known as [[May Day]]) is also observed in Pakistan on [[May 1]]. \n\nSeveral important festivals are celebrated by Pakistani Muslims during the year, dependent on the [[Islamic calendar]]. [[Ramadan]], the ninth month of the calendar, is characterised by daytime fasting for 29 or 30 days and is followed by the festival of [[Eid ul-Fitr]]. In a second festival, [[Eid ul-Adha]], an animal is sacrificed in remembrance of the actions of [[Abraham]] and the meat is shared with friends, family, and the less fortunate. Both Eid festivals are public holidays, serving as oppurtunities for people to visit family and friends, and for children to receive new clothes, presents, and sweets.\n\nSome Muslims celebrate [[Milad al-Nabi|Eid-e-Milad-un-Nabi]], the birthday of the prophet [[Muhammad]], in the third month of the calendar ([[Rabi' al-Awwal]]). [[Shi'a Islam|Shia Muslims]] mark the [[Day of Ashurah]] on the 9th and 10th days of the first month ([[Muharram]]) to commemorate the martyrdom of [[Husayn bin Ali]], (the grandson of prophet [[Muhammad]]). Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs, and Christians in Pakistan also celebrate their own festivals and holidays. [[Sikhs]] come from across the world to visit several holy sites in [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]], including the shrine of [[Guru Nanak]], the founder of [[Sikhism]], at Hassan Abdal in the [[Attock District]], and his birthplace, at [[Nankana Sahib]]. There are also several regional and local festivals, such as the [[Punjabi]] festival of [[Basant]], which marks the start of spring and is celebrated by kite flying.\n\n== Sports ==\n{{main|Sports in Pakistan}}\n[[Image:Rawalpindi_cricket.jpg|thumb|200px|The [[Rawalpindi]] cricket stadium]]\nThe official and national sport of Pakistan is [[field hockey]], although [[squash (sport)|squash]] and [[cricket]] are also very popular. The [[Pakistani cricket team|national cricket team]] has won the [[Cricket World Cup]] once (in [[1992 Cricket World Cup|1992]]), were runners-up once (in [[1999 Cricket World Cup|1999]]) and co-hosted the games twice (in [[1987 Cricket World Cup|1987]] and [[1996 Cricket World Cup|1996]]). The team has also won the [[Australasia Cup]] in 1986, 1990, and 1994.\n\nAt an international level, Pakistan has competed many times at the [[Summer Olympic Games|Summer Olympics]] in field hockey, [[boxing]], [[athletics]], [[swimming]], and [[shooting]]. Hockey is the sport that Pakistan has been most successful at the Olympics, with three gold medals ([[Hockey at the 1960 Summer Olympics|1960]], [[Hockey at the 1968 Summer Olympics|1968]], [[Hockey at the 1984 Summer Olympics|1984]]). Pakistan has also won the [[Hockey World Cup]] four times (1971, 1978, 1982, 1994).<ref name=\"hockey\">[http://www.bharatiyahockey.org/olympics/2004/pakistan.htm Bharatiya Hockey]</ref> Pakistan has hosted several international competitions, including the [[South Asian Federation Games|SAFG]] in 1989 and 2004.\n\n[[A1 Grand Prix]] racing is also becoming popular with the entry of a [[A1 Team Pakistan|Pakistani team]] in the 2005 season. The [[Tour de Pakistan]], modelled on the [[Tour de France]], is an annual cycling competition that covers the length and breadth of Pakistan. Recently, [[football]] has grown in popularity across the country, where traditionally it had been played almost exclusively in the western province of Balochistan.\n\n== See also ==\n{{PakistanTopics}}\n{{Pakistan ties}}\n\n== Notes ==\n<!-- If not explicitly said, all URLs accessed prior to March 27, 2006. -->\n<div class=\"references-small\">\n<references/>\n</div>\n\n== Additional references ==\n<div class=\"references-small\">\n* Cohen, Stephen P. <u>The Idea of Pakistan</u>.
