Language, religion, and [[caste]] are determinants of social and political organisation within the highly diverse population. India's biggest [[metropolitan area|metropolitan]] agglomerations are [[Mumbai]] (formerly ''Bombay''), [[Delhi]], [[Kolkata]] (formerly ''Calcutta'') and [[Chennai]] (formerly ''Madras'').\n\nIndia's [[literacy|literacy rate]] is 64.8%, 53.7% for females and 75.3% of males. The sex ratio is 933 females per 1000 males.{{inote|literacy}} [[Work Participation Rate]] (WPR; the percentage of workers to total population) is 39.1%, with male WPR at 51.7% and female WPR at 25.6% {{inote|eu}} India's median age is 24.66, and the population growth rate is 22.32 births per 1,000.{{inote|demostats}}\n\n[[Image:Akshardhamindelhi.jpg|thumb|270px|The [[Akshardham]] [[Hindu]] temple, [[Delhi]] ]]\nAlthough 80.5% of the people are [[Hinduism|Hindus]], India is also home to the [[Islam by country|third-largest]] population of [[Muslim]]s in the world (13.4%; see [[Islam in India]]), after [[Indonesia]] and [[Pakistan]]. Other religious groups include [[Christianity|Christians]] (2.3%), [[Sikhism|Sikhs]] (1.84%), [[Buddhism|Buddhists]] (0.76%), [[Jainism|Jains]] (0.40%), [[Jew]]s, [[Zoroastrians]], [[Ahmadi|Ahmadi-muslims]], and [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith|Bah\u00e1'\u00ed]]s.{{inote|religion}}\n\nIndia is home to two major [[Languages of India|linguistic families]]: [[Indo-Aryan]] (spoken by about 74% of the population) and [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]] (spoken by about 24%). Other languages spoken in India come from the [[Austro-Asiatic]] and [[Tibeto-Burman]] linguistic families. The Indian constitution recognises 23 official languages{{ref|languages}}. [[Hindi]] and [[English language|English]] are used by the [[Government of India|Central Government]] for official purposes. Two [[classical languages]] native to the land are [[Sanskrit]] and [[Tamil language|Tamil]]. The number of [[Indian languages|mother tongues]] in India is as high as 1,652.{{inote|tongues}}\n\n==Culture==\n{{main articles|[[Arts and Entertainment in India]] and [[Culture of India]]}}\n[[Image:Taj Mahal in March 2004.jpg|thumb|270px|right|The [[Taj Mahal]] in [[Agra]] is India's most popular tourist destination.]]\n\nIndia has a rich and unique cultural heritage, and has managed to preserve its established traditions throughout history. It has always absorbed customs, traditions and ideas from both invaders and immigrants. Many cultural practices, languages, customs and even monuments are examples of this co-mingling over centuries. Famous monuments, such as the [[Taj Mahal]] and other examples of Islamic-inspired architecture have been inherited from the Mughal dynasty. These are the result of a syncretic tradition that combined elements from all parts of the country.\n\nIndian society is largely pluralist, multilingual and multicultural. Religious practices of various faiths are an integral part of everyday life in society. Education is highly regarded by members of every socio-economic stratum. Traditional Indian family values are highly respected, and considered sacred, although urban families have grown to prefer a [[nuclear family]] system, owing to the socio-economic constraints imposed by the traditional [[complex family|joint family]] system.\n\nReligion in India is a very public affair, with many practices imbued with pomp and vitality accompanying their underlying spiritual qualities. \n[[Image:gumpa.jpg|thumb|270px|The Gumpa dance is a mystic dance celebrated by the [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhist]] community in [[Sikkim]] during the Buddhist New Year &mdash; [[Losar]]]]\n\nA melting pot of many religions, India has a rich diversity of [[Indian festivals|festivals]], many of which are celebrated by all, irrespective of caste and creed. The most widely known and popular celebrations include the Hindu festivals of [[Diwali]], [[Holi]], and [[Dussehra]], and the Muslim celebration of [[Eid]]. \n\n[[Music of India|Indian music]] is represented in a wide variety of forms. The two main forms of [[Indian classical music|classical music]] are ''[[Carnatic music|Carnatic]]'' from [[South India]], and ''[[Hindustani classical music|Hindustani]]'' from [[North India]]. Popular forms of music also prevail, the most notable being [[Filmi music]]. In addition to this are the diverse traditions of [[Indian folk music|folk music]] from different parts of the country. Many [[Indian classical dance|classical dance forms]] exist, including the [[Bharatanatyam]], [[Kathakali]], [[Kathak]] and [[Manipuri]]. They often have a narrative form (based on the [[itihasa]] (Indian epics), and are usually infused with devotional and spiritual elements. \n\nThe earliest [[Indian literature|literary traditions]] in India were mostly oral, and were later transcribed. Most of these spring from Indian (later called [[Hindu]]) traditions, and are represented by sacred works like the [[Vedas]] and the epics of the [[Mahabharatha]] and [[Ramayana]]. [[Sangam]] literature from Tamil Nadu represents some of India's oldest traditions. There have been many notable modern Indian writers, both in Indian languages and [[Indian Writing in English|in English]]. India's only [[Nobel Prize for Literature|Nobel laureate in literature]] was the [[Bengali language|Bengali]] writer [[Rabindranath Tagore]].\n\n[[Image:Lunch from Karnataka on a plantain leaf.jpg|thumb|270px|Food in south India is occasionally eaten on a plantain leaf.]]\nIndia produces the world's largest number of [[Cinema of India|films]] every year. The most recognisable face is that of cinema production based in [[Mumbai]], which produces mainly commercial [[Hindi]] films, often referred to as \"[[Bollywood]]\". Cinema in other vernacular languages is also particularly strong, with movies regularly produced in well-established [[Kannada language|Kannada]], [[Malayalam]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]] and [[Telugu language|Telugu]] industries. India's contribution to world cinema was the internationally renowned [[Bengali language|Bengali]] director [[Satyajit Ray]], who in 1992 won an [[Academy Honorary Award|Academy Award for Lifetime Achievement]].\n\n[[Rice]] and [[wheat]] are the staple foods in the country. The [[cuisine of India]] is extremely diverse, as ingredients, spices and cooking methods vary from region to region. The country is notable for its wide variety of [[vegetarian]] and non vegetarian [[wikibooks:Cookbook:Cuisine of India|cuisine]]. Spicy food and sweets are popular in India. [[Indian Dress|Traditional dress]] in India greatly varies across the regions in its colours and styles, and depend on various factors, including climate. The traditional [[sari]] is a popular style of dress for women. Traditional raiments for men is [[dhoti]].\n{{see also|List of World Heritage sites in India|Indian architecture|Indian family name|Cuisine of India}}\n\n==Sports and games==\n{{main|Sports in India}}\n\nIndia's national sport is [[field hockey]], although [[cricket]] is now the ''de facto'' national game due to its success and popularity in recent times. However, cricket is not the most popular sport in some states, particularly in the North Eastern parts of the country where soccer is favoured more. [[Chess]] is another international sport in which India is quite strong: [[Viswanathan Anand]] was [[FIDE]] World Champion, and several players have made significant inroads in recent years, well past the [[International Grandmaster|Grandmaster]] level. India also has a tradition of cue sports ([[snooker]], [[billiards]], etc) and shooting.\n\nIndia has had relatively little success in other international events like the [[Olympics]], where it garnered just one silver medal and two bronze medals in the previous three outings. However, it had won eight [[field hockey]] golds until 1980. India has done rather well in [[Davis Cup]] [[tennis]] tournaments, reaching the finals on three occasions. Its players have secured several individual titles and [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] doubles wins, but an Indian is yet to win a Grand Slam singles.\n\nTraditional indigenous sports include [[polo]], [[kabaddi]], [[Kho Kho]] and [[gilli-danda]], which are played in most parts of the country. Chess, [[badminton]] and [[carrom]] are also said to have originated in India. Snooker and badminton have seen Indians achieve some international success. [[Football (soccer)]] is also widely watched in almost the entire country, and is the most popular sport in many states, though India ranks above 100 in the FIFA rankings. [[Formula 1]] racing is also increasing in popularity, due to racing driver [[Narain Karthikeyan]], though its reach is largely limited to urban areas.\n\n==Holidays==\n{{main|List of Festivals in India}}\n\nIndia has three National Holidays. Other sets of holidays, varying between nine to twelve, pertains to festivals, religious holidays and births of leaders which are legislated by the individual states.\n<center>\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"3\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"90%\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse; border:1px solid #aaa; text-align:left\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#efefef;\" width=\"15%\" | Date\n! style=\"background:#efefef;\" width=\"20%\" | Holiday\n! style=\"background:#efefef;\" | Remarks\n|-\n| [[26 January]]\n| [[Republic Day of India|Republic Day]]\n| The constitution of India came into effect on this day in the year 1950.\n|-\n| [[15 August]]\n| [[Indian Independence Day|Independence Day]]\n| India gained its independence from the British Empire on this day in 1947.\n|-\n| [[2 October]]\n| [[Gandhi Jayanti]]\n| The birth anniversary of [[Mahatma Gandhi]].\n|}\n</center>\n\n==See also==\n{{Topics related to India}}\n\n==External links==\n{{portal}}\n{{sisterlinks|India}}\n\n<!--PLEASE ADD SITES RELATING TO INDIA AS A WHOLE.

This state borders a part of [[Afghanistan]]. A ceasefire sponsored by the [[United Nations]] in 1948 freezes the positions of Indian and Pakistani held territory. As a consequence, the region bordering Afghanistan is in Pakistani-administered territory.\n*{{mnb|LoC|2}} The black line is the boundary as recognised by the government of India. The northern region of [[Kashmir]] is currently administered by India, Pakistan, and China (and coloured in as such). The delimiting of the three administered regions is ''not'' the international boundary but a ceasefire line demarcated in red. The boundary separating India and Pakistan is known as the [[Line of Control]], that separating India and China as the '[[Line of Actual Control]]'. Most of the state of [[Arunachal Pradesh]] is still claimed by China.\n\n----\n* '''India''' is also the letter '''[[I]]''' in the [[NATO phonetic alphabet]].\n\n{{India ties}}\n{{Life in India}}\n\n{{featured article}}\n\n[[Category:India|*]]\n[[Category:Republics]]\n[[Category:Members of the Commonwealth of Nations]]\n[[Category:SAARC members]]\n[[Category:Former British colonies]]\n\n{{Link FA|de}}\n{{Link FA|sv}}\n\n[[af:Indi\u00eb]]\n[[als:Indien]]\n[[an:India]]\n[[ang:India]]\n[[ar:\u0647\u0646\u062f]]\n[[as:\u09ad\u09be\u09b0\u09a4]]\n[[ast:India]]\n[[ay:India]]\n[[be:\u0406\u043d\u0434\u044b\u044f]]\n[[bg:\u0418\u043d\u0434\u0438\u044f]]\n[[bh:\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924]]\n[[bn:\u09ad\u09be\u09b0\u09a4]]\n[[br:India]]\n[[bs:Indija]]\n[[ca:\u00cdndia]]\n[[chr:India]]\n[[ps:\u0647\u0646\u062f\u0648\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646]]\n[[co:India]]\n[[cr:India]]\n[[cs:Indie]]\n[[csb:Indie]]\n[[cv:\u0418\u043d\u0434\u0438]]\n[[cy:India]]\n[[da:Indien]]\n[[de:Indien]]\n[[dv:\u0780\u07a8\u0782\u07b0\u078b\u07aa\u0790\u07b0\u078c\u07a7\u0782\u07b0]]\n[[el:\u0399\u03bd\u03b4\u03af\u03b1]]\n[[eo:Barato]]\n[[es:India]]\n[[et:India]]\n[[eu:India]]\n[[fa:\u0647\u0646\u062f]]\n[[fi:Intia]]\n[[fo:India]]\n[[fr:Inde]]\n[[fur:Indie]]\n[[fy:Yndia]]\n[[ga:An India]]\n[[gd:Na h-Innseachan]]\n[[gl:India - \u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924]]\n[[gn:India]]\n[[got:\ud800\udf39\ud800\udf3d\ud800\udf33\ud800\udf39\ud800\udf30]]\n[[gu:\u0aad\u0abe\u0ab0\u0aa4]]\n[[haw:\u02bbInia]]\n[[he:\u05d4\u05d5\u05d3\u05d5]]\n[[hi:\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924]]\n[[hr:Indija]]\n[[ht:End]]\n[[hu:India]]\n[[hy:\u0540\u0576\u0564\u056f\u0561\u057d\u057f\u0561\u0576]]\n[[ia:India]]\n[[id:India]]\n[[io:India]]\n[[is:Indland]]\n[[it:India]]\n[[iu:\u1403\u14d0\u144e\u140a]]\n[[ja:\u30a4\u30f3\u30c9]]\n[[jbo:barat]]\n[[jv:India]]\n[[ka:\u10d8\u10dc\u10d3\u10dd\u10d4\u10d7\u10d8]]\n[[kk:\u04ae\u043d\u0434\u0456\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d]]\n[[km:\u17a5\u178e\u17d2\u178c\u17b6]]\n[[kn:\u0cad\u0cbe\u0cb0\u0ca4]]\n[[ko:\uc778\ub514\uc544]]\n[[ks:\u06c1\u0650\u0646\u062f\u0648\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646]]\n[[ku:Hindistan]]\n[[kw:Eynda]]\n[[la:India]]\n[[lb:Indien]]\n[[li:India]]\n[[lt:Indija]]\n[[lv:Indija]]\n[[mi:Inia (whenua)]]\n[[mk:\u0418\u043d\u0434\u0438\u0458\u0430]]\n[[ml:\u0d07\u0d28\u0d4d\u0d24\u0d4d\u0d2f]]\n[[mr:\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924]]\n[[ms:India]]\n[[mt:Indja]]\n[[na:India]]\n[[nah:India]]\n[[nap:Innia]]\n[[nds:Indien]]\n[[ne:\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924]]\n[[nl:India]]\n[[nn:India]]\n[[no:India]]\n[[oc:\u00cdndia]]\n[[or:\u0b2d\u0b3e\u0b30\u0b24]]\n[[os:\u0418\u043d\u0434\u0438]]\n[[pa:\u0a2d\u0a3e\u0a30\u0a24]]\n[[pl:Indie]]\n[[ps:\u0647\u0646\u062f]]\n[[pt:\u00cdndia]]\n[[qu:Indiya]]\n[[rm:India]]\n[[ro:India]]\n[[ru:\u0418\u043d\u0434\u0438\u044f]]\n[[sa:\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924]]\n[[sc:\u00ccndia]]\n[[scn:India]]\n[[sd:\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924]]\n[[se:India]]\n[[sh:Indija]]\n[[simple:India]]\n[[sk:India]]\n[[sl:Indija]]\n[[sq:India]]\n[[sr:\u0418\u043d\u0434\u0438\u0458\u0430]]\n[[su:India]]\n[[sv:Indien]]\n[[sw:Uhindi]]\n[[ta:\u0b87\u0ba8\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0bbf\u0baf\u0bbe]]\n[[te:\u0c2d\u0c3e\u0c30\u0c24 \u0c26\u0c47\u0c36\u0c2e\u0c41]]\n[[tg:\u04b2\u0438\u043d\u0434\u0443\u0441\u0442\u043e\u043d]]\n[[th:\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e30\u0e40\u0e17\u0e28\u0e2d\u0e34\u0e19\u0e40\u0e14\u0e35\u0e22]]\n[[tl:Indya]]\n[[tpi:India]]\n[[tr:Hindistan]]\n[[tt:Hindstan]]\n[[uk:\u0406\u043d\u0434\u0456\u044f]]\n[[ur:\u0628\u06be\u0627\u0631\u062a]]\n[[uz:Hindiston]]\n[[vi:\u1ea4n \u0110\u1ed9]]\n[[wa:Inde]]\n[[yi:\u05d0\u05d9\u05e0\u05d3\u05d9\u05b4\u05d9\u05e2]]\n[[yo:India]]\n[[zh:\u5370\u5ea6]]\n[[zh-min-nan:\u00ccn-t\u014d\u00b7]]"
