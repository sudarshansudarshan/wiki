A third name, ''[[Hindustan]]'' ( <!-- THIS SPELLING IS CORRECT. PLEASE READ [[Wikipedia:text support for Indic scripts]] --> /{{IPA|hin\u032ad\u032aust\u032a\u0251\u02d0n}}/) {{Audio|Hindustan.ogg|listen}} ([[Persian language|Persian]]: ''[[-stan|Land]] of the Hindus'' ([[Old Persian]] for [[Indus river|Indus]]) has been used since the twelfth century, though its contemporary use is unevenly applied.\n\n==History==\n<!-- THIS SECTION IS A SUMMARY. CONSIDER ADDING MATERIAL TO THE 'HISTORY OF INDIA' ARTICLE.-->\n{{main|History of India}}\n\n[[Stone Age]] rock shelters with paintings at [[Bhimbetka]] in [[Madhya Pradesh]] are the earliest known traces of human life on the [[Indian subcontinent]]. The first known permanent settlements appeared over 9,000 years ago, and gradually developed into the [[Indus Valley Civilization]], dating back to 3300 BCE. It was followed by the [[Vedic Civilization]] which laid the foundations of [[Hinduism]] and other cultural aspects of early Indian society. From around 550 BCE, many independent kingdoms and republics known as the [[Mahajanapadas]] were established across the country. \n\nThe empire built by the [[Maurya dynasty]] under Emperor [[Ashoka]] united most of modern [[South Asia]] except the kingdoms in the south. From 180 BCE, a series of invasions from [[Central Asia]] followed including the [[Indo-Greek]]s, [[Indo-Scythian]]s, [[Indo-Parthian]]s and [[Kushan Empire|Kushans]] in the northwestern [[Indian Subcontinent]]. From the third century CE, the [[Gupta|Gupta dynasty]] oversaw the period referred to as ancient India's \"Golden Age.\" While the north had larger, fewer kingdoms, in the south there were several dynasties such as the [[Chalukyas]], [[Cholas]], [[Pallavas]] and [[Pandyas]], overlapping in time and space. [[Ancient Indian science and technology|Science, engineering]], [[Indian art|art]], [[Indian literature|literature]], [[Indian science|astronomy]], and [[Indian philosophy|philosophy]] flourished under the patronage of these kings.\n\n[[Image:Indischer version3.jpg|thumb|left|Paintings at the Ajanta Caves in western India.]]\nFollowing the invasions from [[Central Asia]], between the tenth to the twelfth centuries, much of north India came under the rule of the [[Delhi Sultanate]], and later the [[Mughal dynasty]], who gradually expanded their reign through large parts of the Indian subcontinent. Nevertheless, several indigenous kingdoms flourished, especially in the south, like the [[Vijayanagara Empire]]. In the seventeenth and eighteenth century, the [[Mughal]] supremacy declined and the [[Maratha Empire]] became the dominant power. From the sixteenth century onwards, several [[Europe|European]] countries, including [[Portugal]], [[Netherlands]], [[France]] and the [[United Kingdom]], started arriving as traders, later taking advantage of the fractious nature of relations between the kingdoms, to establish [[colony|colonies]] in the country. By 1856, most of India came under control of the [[British East India Company]]. A year later, a nationwide insurrection of rebelling military units and kingdoms, known locally as the [[Indian rebellion of 1857|First War of Indian Independence]] (known as the Sepoy Mutiny elsewhere) broke out, which failed even as it seriously challenged British rule. As a consequence, India came under the direct control of the [[British Crown]] as a colony of the British Empire.\n\n[[Image:Nehru Gandhi 1937 touchup.jpg|thumb|[[Mahatma Gandhi]] (right) with India's first prime minister, [[Jawaharlal Nehru]]]]\nFrom early twentieth century, the [[Indian Independence Movement]] of the [[Indian National Congress]] steadily gained widespread support, largely led by [[Mahatma Gandhi]]. Millions of protesters would engage in mass campaigns of [[civil disobedience]] with a commitment to ''[[ahimsa]]'' or non-violence. Finally, on [[15 August]], [[1947]], India gained independence from British rule not before losing its Muslim-majority areas which were carved out into a separate [[nation-state]] of Pakistan. Three years later, on [[26 January]], [[1950]], India chose to be a republic, and a new [[Constitution of India|Constitution]] came into effect.\n\nSince independence, India has seen sectarian violence and [[insurgency|insurgencies]] in various parts of the country, but has maintained its unity and democracy. It has unresolved territorial disputes with China, which escalated into the brief [[Sino-Indian War]] in 1962; and with Pakistan, which resulted in wars in [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1947|1947]], [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965|1965]], [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971|1971]] and in 1999 in [[Kargil War|Kargil]]. India is a founding member of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] and the [[United Nations]] (as part of British India). In 1974, India conducted an underground [[Smiling Buddha|nuclear test]]. This was followed by [[Operation Shakti|five more]] tests in 1998. Significant economic reforms beginning in 1991 have transformed India into one of the fastest-growing economies and [[India as an emerging superpower|an emerging superpower]] in the world, and added to its global and regional clout.\n\n==Government==\n{{main|Government of India}}\n{{Indian symbols}}\n\nThe Constitution of India declares India to be a [[sovereignty|sovereign]], [[socialism|socialist]], [[secularism|secular]], [[liberal democracy|democratic]] [[republic]]. India has a federal form of government and a [[bicameralism|bicameral]] [[parliament]] operating under a [[Westminster System|Westminster-style]] parliamentary system. It has three branches of governance: the [[Legislature]], [[Executive]], and [[Judiciary]].\n\nThe [[President of India|President]] is the [[head of state]]; his role in governance is largely ceremonial. The President is elected indirectly by an [[electoral college]] for five-year terms. The [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Minister]] is the de facto [[head of government]] and holds most executive powers. He or she is appointed by the President, with the requirement that he or she enjoys the support of the majority of the party or coalition securing the most number of seats in the lower house of Parliament.\n\nThe legislature o"
