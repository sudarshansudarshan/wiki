India has a coastline of over seven thousand kilometres,<ref name=\"indianembassy\">{{cite web | title = Foreign Policy of India | work = Indian Embassy | url = http://www.indianembassy.org/policy/Foreign_Policy/2004/AR2004.htm | accessdate = March 24 | accessyear = 2006}}</ref> and borders [[Pakistan]]<ref name=\"afgh\">The Government of India considers the entire state of [[Jammu and Kashmir]] to be a part of India including the portion bordering [[Afghanistan]].

As a consequence, the region bordering Afghanistan is in Pakistani-administered territory.</ref> to the west, [[Nepal]], the [[People's Republic of China]] and [[Bhutan]] to the north-east, and [[Bangladesh]] and [[Myanmar]] to the east. In the [[Indian Ocean]], it is adjacent to the [[island nation]]s of [[Sri Lanka]], [[Maldives]] and [[Indonesia]]. \n\nHome to the [[Indus Valley Civilization]], a centre of important trade routes and vast empires, India has long played a major role in human history. [[Hinduism]], [[Sikhism]], [[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]], all have their origins in India, while [[Islam]] and [[Christianity]] enjoy a strong cultural heritage. Colonised as part of the [[British Empire]] in the nineteenth century, India gained independence in 1947 as a unified nation after an intense [[Indian independence movement|struggle for independence]]. The country has one of the most diverse populations, wildlife, geographical terrain and climate systems found anywhere in the world.\n\n==Etymology==\n{{main|Origin of India's name}}\nThe name ''India'' /{{IPA|'\u026andi\u0259}}/ is derived from ''[[Indus River|Indus]]'', which is derived from the [[Old Persian]] word ''[[Hindu]]'', from [[Sanskrit]] ''[[Sindhu]]'', the historic local appellation for the [[Indus River]]. \nThe [[Constitution of India]] and common usage also recognise '''Bharat'''  {{IPA|/b\u02b0\u0251\u02d0r\u0259t\u032a/}} {{Audio|Bharat.ogg|listen}}), as an official name of equal status.

CONSIDER ADDING MATERIAL TO THE 'HISTORY OF INDIA' ARTICLE.-->\n{{main|History of India}}\n\n[[Stone Age]] rock shelters with paintings at [[Bhimbetka]] in the state of [[Madhya Pradesh]] are the earliest known traces of human life in India. The first known permanent settlements appeared over 9,000 years ago, and gradually developed into the [[Indus Valley Civilisation]], began in around 3300 BCE in western India. It was followed by the [[Vedic Civilisation]] which laid the foundations of [[Hinduism]] and other cultural aspects of early Indian society. From around 550 BCE, many independent kingdoms and republics known as the [[Mahajanapadas]] were established across the country. \n\nThe empire built by the [[Maurya dynasty]] under Emperor [[Ashoka]] united modern [[South Asia]]. From 180 BCE, a series of invasions from [[Central Asia]] followed including the [[Indo-Greek]]s, [[Indo-Scythian]]s, [[Indo-Parthian]]s and [[Kushan Empire|Kushans]] in the northwestern [[Indian Subcontinent]]. From the third century CE, the [[Gupta|Gupta dynasty]] oversaw the period referred to as ancient India's \"Golden Age.\" In the south, several dynasties, including the [[Chalukyas]], [[Rashtrakutas]], [[Hoysalas]], [[Cheras]], [[Cholas]], [[Pallavas]] and [[Pandyas]] prevailed during different periods. [[Ancient Indian science and technology|Science, engineering]], [[Indian art|art]], [[Indian literature|literature]], [[Indian Mathematics|mathematics]], [[Indian science|astronomy]], [[Religion in India|religion]] and [[Indian philosophy|philosophy]] flourished under the patronage of these kings.\n[[Image:Sanchi2.jpg|thumb|left|270px|The [[Sanchi|Sanchi stupa]] in Sanchi, [[Madhya Pradesh]] built by emperor Ashoka in the 3rd century BC]]\nFollowing the invasions from Central Asia, between the tenth to the twelfth centuries, much of north India came under the rule of the [[Delhi Sultanate]], and later the [[Mughal dynasty]], who gradually expanded their reign throughout large parts of the Indian subcontinent. Nevertheless, several indigenous kingdoms flourished, especially in the south, like the [[Vijayanagara Empire]]. During the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, several [[Europe|European]] countries, including [[Portugal]], [[Netherlands]], [[France]] and the [[United Kingdom]], initially arrived as traders, later took advantage of the fractious nature of relations between the kingdoms, to establish [[colony|colonies]] in the country. By 1856, most of India came under control of the [[British East India Company]]. A year later, a nationwide insurrection of rebelling military units and kingdoms, known locally as the [[Indian rebellion of 1857|First War of Indian Independence]] (known as the Sepoy Mutiny elsewhere) broke out, which failed even as it seriously challenged British rule. India thus came under the direct control of the [[British Crown]] as a colony of the British Empire.\n\n[[Image:Nehru Gandhi 1937 touchup.jpg|thumb|270px|right|[[Mahatma Gandhi]] (right) with India's first Prime Minister, Pandit [[Jawaharlal Nehru]]]]\nIn the early twentieth century, a nationwide [[Indian Independence Movement|struggle for independence]] was launched by the [[Indian National Congress]], largely led by [[Mahatma Gandhi]] and during [[Second World War]] by [[Indian National Army]] led by [[Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose]]. Millions of protestors would engage in mass campaigns of [[civil disobedience]] with a commitment to ''[[ahimsa]]'' or non-violence and the entire nation was rejuvenated in 1945-46 during the historical trial of [[Indian National Army]] officers at Red Fort, Delhi followed by [[Naval Mutiny]] in Bombay. Finally, on [[15 August]], 1947, India gained independence from British rule. Three years later, on [[26 January]], 1950, India chose to be a republic, and a new [[Constitution of India|Constitution]] came into effect.\n\nSince independence, India has seen sectarian violence and [[insurgency|insurgencies]] in various parts of the country, but has maintained its unity and democracy. It has unresolved territorial disputes with China, which escalated into the brief [[Sino-Indian War]] in 1962; and with Pakistan, which resulted in wars in [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1947|1947]], [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965|1965]], [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971|1971]] and in 1999 in [[Kargil War|Kargil]]. India is a founding member of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] and the [[United Nations]] (as part of British India). In 1974, India conducted an underground [[Smiling Buddha|nuclear test]]. This was followed by [[Operation Shakti|five more]] tests in 1998. Significant economic reforms beginning in 1991 have transformed India into one of the fastest-growing economies in the world, and added to its global and regional clout.\n{{see also|Military history of India|Timeline of Indian history}}\n\n==Government==\n{{main|Government of India}}\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 0.75em; margin-bottom: 0.5em; padding: 0.5em; width:220px; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\"\n|+ '''National symbols of India'''\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left: 1em;\" | '''Flag'''\n| [[Tiranga]]                                                \n|-\n| style=\"padding-left: 1em;\" | '''Emblem'''\n| [[Emblem of India|Sarnath Lion]]\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left: 1em;\" | '''Anthem'''\n| \"[[Jana Gana Mana]]\"\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left: 1em;\" | '''Song'''\n| \"[[Vande Mataram|Vand\u0113 M\u0101taram]]\"\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left: 1em;\" | '''Animal'''\n| [[Bengal Tiger|Royal Bengal Tiger]]\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left: 1em;\" | '''Bird'''\n| [[Indian Peacock]]\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left: 1em;\" | '''Flower'''\n| [[Nelumbo nucifera|Lotus]]\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left: 1em;\" | '''Tree'''\n| [[Banyan]]\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left: 1em;\" | '''Fruit'''\n| [[Mango]]\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left: 1em;\" | '''Sport'''\n| [[Field Hockey]]\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left: 1em;\" | '''Calendar'''\n| [[Indian National Calendar|Saka]]\n|\n|}\nThe Consitution of India states that India is a [[sovereignty|sovereign]], [[socialist]], [[secular]], [[democratic]] [[republic]]. It is often referred to as the largest democracy in the world, by virtue of the fact that it has the largest [[electorate|electing population]] amongst [[List of democratic states|democratic countries]].  India has a federal form of government and a [[bicameral]] [[parliament]] operating under a [[Westminster System|Westminster-style]] parliamentary system. It has three branches of governance: the [[Legislature]], [[Executive]] and [[Judiciary]].\n\nThe [[President of India|President]] is the [[head of state]], though he has a largely ceremonial role to play. He is also the Supreme Commander of [[Indian military|India's armed forces]]. The President is elected indirectly by an [[electoral college]] for five-year terms.The President can also nominate a maximum twelve members to the Upper house of the Parliament([[Rajya Sabha]]). The Presidential assent is needed for a Bill or Ordinance passed by the Parliament to come into force. The [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Minister]] is the de facto [[head of government]], and has most executive powers. He or she is appointed by the President, with the requirement that he or she enjoy the support of the majority of the party or coalition securing the most number of seats in lower house of the Parliament. The Union Council of Ministers headed by the Prime Minister aids and advices the President on governance matters.\n\nThe legislature of India is the bicameral [[Indian Parliament|Parliament]], which consists of the upper house called the [[Rajya Sabha]] (Council of States), and the lower house called the [[Lok Sabha]] (House of People). The 245-member Rajya Sabha is chosen indirectly through the state Legislative Assemblies, and has a staggered six-year term. Each state sends members to the Rajya Sabha in a proportion of its population. The 545-member Lok Sabha is directly elected by popular vote for a five-year term(except two nominated Anglo-Indian members), and is the determinative constituent of political power and government formation. Universal adulthood suffrage is guaranteed by the Constitution for citizens above 18 years of age.  \nThe executive arm consists of the President, Vice-President, and the [[Council of Ministers]] (the [[Cabinet]] being its executive committee) headed by the Prime Minister. Any minister holding a portfolio must be a member of either house of parliament. In the Indian parliamentary system, the executive is subordinate to the legislature. The Executive also has the power to dissolve the House earlier than the completion date and call for a fresh election at its convienience. \n\nIndia's independent judiciary consists of the [[Supreme Court of India|Supreme Court]], headed by the [[Chief Justice of India]]. The Supreme Court has both original jurisdiction over disputes between states and the Centre, and appellate jurisdiction over the eighteen [[High Courts of India]], and additionally, the power to declare Union and state laws null and void if in conflict with the Constitution.<ref name=\"manorama\">{{cite book | first = K.M. | last = Matthew | title = Manorama Yearbook 2003 | publisher = Malaya Manorama | year = 2006 | id = ISBN 8189004077 | pages = pg 524 }}</ref>The Supreme Court is also the legal custodian of the Fundamendal Rights enforcement in the country.\n\n==Politics==\n{{main2|Politics of India|Foreign relations of India}}\n[[image:IndiaMap2.PNG|thumb|270px|Map of India <ref name=\"loc\">The black line is the boundary as recognised by the government of India. The northern region of [[Kashmir]] is currently administered by India, Pakistan, and China (and coloured in as such). The delimiting of the three administered regions is ''not'' the international boundary but a ceasefire line demarcated in red. The boundary separating India and Pakistan is known as the [[Line of Control]], that separating India and China as the '[[Line of Actual Control]]'. Most of the state of [[Arunachal Pradesh]] is still claimed by China.</ref>.]]\nFor most of its independent history, India has been ruled by the [[Indian National Congress]]. The party enjoyed a parliamentary majority barring two brief periods during the 1970s and late 1980s. This rule was interrupted between 1977 to 1980, when the [[Janata Party]] coalition won the election owing to public discontent with the [[Indian Emergency|\"Emergency\"]] declared by the then Prime Minister [[Indira Gandhi]]. The [[Janata Dal]] won elections in 1989, but its government managed to hold on to power for only two years. Between 1996 and 1998, there was a period of political flux with the government being formed first by the [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] nationalist [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] followed by a left-leaning [[United Front (India)|United Front]] coalition. In 1998, the BJP formed the [[National Democratic Alliance]] (NDA) with smaller regional parties, and became the first non-Congress and coalition government to complete a full five-year term. The [[Indian general elections, 2004|2004 Indian elections]] saw the Congress party winning the largest number of seats to form a government leading the [[United Progressive Alliance]], and supported by left-parties and those opposed to the BJP.\n\nSince independence, India has maintained cordial relationships with most nations. It took a lead in the 1950s in advocating the independence of European colonies in Africa and Asia. During the [[Cold War]], India tried to maintain its neutrality and was one of the founding members of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]]. After the [[Sino-Indian War]] and the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965]], India's relationship with the [[Soviet Union]] warmed at the expense of ties with the [[United States]] and continued to remain so till the end of the Cold War. India has consistently refused to sign the [[CTBT]] and the [[NPT]] to maintain sovereignty over its nuclear program despite criticism and military sanctions. Recent overtures by the Indian government have strengthened India's relations with United States, China and Pakistan. In the economic sphere, India has close relationships with other developing nations of [[South America]], [[Asia]] and [[Africa]]. In recent years, India has played an influential role in the [[SAARC]]. India has been a long time supporter of the [[United Nations]], with over 55,000 [[Indian Armed Forces|Indian military]] and police personnel having served in 35 UN peace keeping operations over four continents <ref name=\"UN\">{{cite web | title = India and the United Nations | url = http://www.un.int/india/india_and_the_un_pkeeping.html | accessdate = April 22 | accessyear = 2006}}</ref>.\n\n==States and union territories==\n{{main|States and territories of India}}\n\nIndia is divided into twenty-eight states (which are further subdivided into [[districts of India|districts]]), and seven [[union territories]] (or territories owned by the Central Government). All states, and the union territories of Delhi and Pondicherry have elected governments. The remaining five union territories have centrally-appointed administrators. The states and territories are further divided into 602 districts.\n\n''See also: [[Districts of India]], [[List of Indian districts]]''\n\n{{India states}}\n\n==Geography==\n{{main|Geography of India}}\n[[Image:Yumthanghimalayas.jpg|thumb|270px|The [[Himalaya]]s stretch from [[Jammu and Kashmir]] in the north to [[Arunachal Pradesh]] in the far east making up most of India's eastern borders]]\nThe territory of India constitutes a major portion of the [[Indian subcontinent]], situated on the [[Indian Plate]], the northerly portion of the [[Indo-Australian Plate]], in [[southern Asia]]. India's northern and northeastern states are partially situated in the [[Himalaya|Himalayan Mountain Range]]. The rest of northern, central and eastern India consists of the fertile [[Indo-Gangetic plain]]. In the west, bordering southeast [[Pakistan]], lies the [[Thar Desert]]. The southern Indian Peninsula is almost entirely composed of the [[Deccan|Deccan plateau]], which is flanked by two hilly coastal ranges, the [[Western Ghats]] and [[Eastern Ghats]].\n\nIndia is home to several major rivers, including the [[Ganges|Ganga]], [[Brahmaputra]], [[Yamuna]], [[Godavari"
