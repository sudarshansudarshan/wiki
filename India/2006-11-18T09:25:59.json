India has a coastline of over seven thousand kilometres, bounded by the [[Indian Ocean]] on the south, the [[Arabian Sea]] on the west, and the [[Bay of Bengal]] on the east. It is bordered by [[Pakistan]]<ref name=\"afgh\">The Government of India considers the entire state of [[Jammu and Kashmir]] to be a part of India including the portion bordering [[Afghanistan]].

In the [[Indian Ocean]], it is adjacent to the [[island nation]]s of [[Sri Lanka]], [[Maldives]] and [[Indonesia]].\n\nHome to the [[Indus Valley Civilization]], a centre of important trade routes and vast empires, India has long played a major role in human history. [[Hinduism]], [[Sikhism]], [[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]], all have their origins in India, while [[Islam]] and [[Christianity]] enjoy a strong cultural heritage. Colonised as part of the [[British Empire]] in the nineteenth century, India gained independence in 1947 as a unified nation after an intense [[Indian independence movement|struggle for independence]]. The country has one of the most diverse populations, wildlife, geographical terrain and climate systems found anywhere in the world.\n\nThe name ''India'' /{{IPA|'\u026andi\u0259}}/ is derived from ''[[Indus River|Indus]]'', which is derived from the [[Old Persian]] word ''[[Hindu]]'', from [[Sanskrit]] ''[[Sindhu]]'', the historic local appellation for the [[Indus River]]. \nThe [[Constitution of India]] and common usage also recognise '''Bharat'''  {{IPA|/b\u02b0\u0251\u02d0r\u0259t\u032a/}} {{Audio|Bharat.ogg|listen}}), as an official name of equal status.

CONSIDER ADDING MATERIAL TO THE 'HISTORY OF INDIA' ARTICLE.-->\n{{main|History of India}}\n\n[[Stone Age]] rock shelters with paintings at [[Bhimbetka]] in [[Madhya Pradesh]] are the earliest known traces of human life in India. The first known permanent settlements appeared over 9,000 years ago, and gradually developed into the [[Indus Valley Civilization]], dating back to 3300 BCE in western India. It was followed by the [[Vedic Civilization]] which laid the foundations of [[Hinduism]] and other cultural aspects of early Indian society. From around 550 BCE, many independent kingdoms and republics known as the [[Mahajanapadas]] were established across the country. \n\nThe empire built by the [[Maurya dynasty]] under Emperor [[Ashoka]] united most of modern [[South Asia]] except the [[Tamil]] kingdoms in the south. From 180 BCE, a series of invasions from [[Central Asia]] followed including the [[Indo-Greek]]s, [[Indo-Scythian]]s, [[Indo-Parthian]]s and [[Kushan Empire|Kushans]] in the northwestern [[Indian Subcontinent]]. From the third century CE, the [[Gupta|Gupta dynasty]] oversaw the period referred to as ancient India's \"Golden Age.\" While the north had larger, fewer kingdoms, in the south there were several dynasties such as the [[Chalukyas]], [[Rashtrakutas]], [[Hoysalas]], [[Cheras]], [[Cholas]], [[Pallavas]] and [[Pandyas]], overlapping in time and space. [[Ancient Indian science and technology|Science, engineering]], [[Indian art|art]], [[Indian literature|literature]], [[Indian Mathematics|mathematics]], [[Indian science|astronomy]], [[Religion in India|religion]] and [[Indian philosophy|philosophy]] flourished under the patronage of these kings.\n\n[[Image:Sanchi2.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Sanchi|Sanchi stupa]] in Sanchi, [[Madhya Pradesh]] built by emperor Ashoka in the 3rd century BC]]\nFollowing the invasions from [[Central Asia]], between the tenth to the twelfth centuries, much of north India came under the rule of the [[Delhi Sultanate]], and later the [[Mughal dynasty]], who gradually expanded their reign through large parts of the Indian subcontinent. Nevertheless, several indigenous kingdoms flourished, especially in the south, like the [[Vijayanagara Empire]]. From the sixteenth century onwards, several [[Europe|European]] countries, including [[Portugal]], [[Netherlands]], [[France]] and the [[United Kingdom]], started arriving as traders, later taking advantage of the fractious nature of relations between the kingdoms, to establish [[colony|colonies]] in the country. By 1856, most of India came under control of the [[British East India Company]]. A year later, a nationwide insurrection of rebelling military units and kingdoms, known locally as the [[Indian rebellion of 1857|First War of Indian Independence]] (known as the Sepoy Mutiny elsewhere) broke out, which failed even as it seriously challenged British rule. As a consequence, India came under the direct control of the [[British Crown]] as a colony of the British Empire.\n\n[[Image:Nehru Gandhi 1937 touchup.jpg|thumb|[[Mahatma Gandhi]] (right) with India's first Prime Minister, [[Jawaharlal Nehru]]]]\nIn the early twentieth century, a nationwide [[Indian Independence Movement|struggle for independence]] was launched by the [[Indian National Congress]], largely led by [[Mahatma Gandhi]]. Millions of protestors would engage in mass campaigns of [[civil disobedience]] with a commitment to ''[[ahimsa]]'' or non-violence. Finally, on [[15 August]], [[1947]], India gained independence from British rule. Three years later, on [[26 January]], [[1950]], India chose to be a republic, and a new [[Constitution of India|Constitution]] came into effect.\n\nSince independence, India has seen sectarian violence and [[insurgency|insurgencies]] in various parts of the country, but has maintained its unity and democracy. It has unresolved territorial disputes with China, which escalated into the brief [[Sino-Indian War]] in 1962; and with Pakistan, which resulted in wars in [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1947|1947]], [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965|1965]], [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971|1971]] and in 1999 in [[Kargil War|Kargil]]. India is a founding member of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] and the [[United Nations]] (as part of British India). In 1974, India conducted an underground [[Smiling Buddha|nuclear test]]. This was followed by [[Operation Shakti|five more]] tests in 1998. Significant economic reforms beginning in 1991 have transformed India into one of the fastest-growing economies and [[India as an emerging superpower|an emerging superpower]] in the world, and added to its global and regional clout.\n\n==Government==\n\n{{main|Government of India}}\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 0.75em; margin-bottom: 0.5em; padding: 0.5em; width:220px; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\"\n|+ '''National symbols of India'''\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left: 1em;\" | '''Flag'''\n| [[Tiranga]]\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left: 1em;\" | '''Emblem'''\n| [[Emblem of India|Sarnath Lion]]\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left: 1em;\" | '''Anthem'''\n| \"[[Jana Gana Mana]]\"\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left: 1em;\" | '''Song'''\n| \"[[Vande Mataram|Vand\u0113 M\u0101taram]]\"\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left: 1em;\" | '''Animal'''\n| [[Bengal Tiger|Royal Bengal Tiger]]\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left: 1em;\" | '''Bird'''\n| [[Indian Peacock]]\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left: 1em;\" | '''Flower'''\n| [[Nelumbo nucifera|Lotus]]\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left: 1em;\" | '''Tree'''\n| [[Banyan]]\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left: 1em;\" | '''Fruit'''\n| [[Mango]]\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left: 1em;\" | '''Sport'''\n| [[Field Hockey]]\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left: 1em;\" | '''Calendar'''\n| [[Indian National Calendar|Saka]]\n|\n|}\nThe Consitution of India declares India to be a [[sovereignty|sovereign]], [[socialist]], [[secular]], [[democratic]] [[republic]]. India has a federal form of government and a [[bicameral]] [[parliament]] operating under a [[Westminster System|Westminster-style]] parliamentary system. It has three branches of governance: the [[Legislature]], [[Executive]] and [[Judiciary]].\n\nThe [[President of India|President]] is the [[head of state]], though he has a largely ceremonial role to play. He is also the [[Commander-in-Chief]] of [[Indian military|India's armed forces]]. The President is elected indirectly by an [[electoral college]] for five-year terms. The [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Minister]] is the ''de facto'' [[head of government]], and has most executive powers. He or she is appointed by the President, with the requirement that he/she enjoys the support of the majority of the party or coalition securing the most number of seats in lower house of the Parliament (the ''[[Lok Sabha]]'').\n\n[[Image:Thesouthblockdelhi.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Secretariat Building]] in New Delhi houses high level offices of the Indian Government.]]\nThe legislature of India is the bicameral [[Indian Parliament|Parliament]], which consists of the upper house called the [[Rajya Sabha]] (Council of States), and the lower house called the [[Lok Sabha]] (House of People). The 245-member ''Rajya Sabha'' is chosen indirectly through the state Legislative Assemblies, and has a staggered six-year term. Each state sends members to the Rajya Sabha in a proportion of its population. The 545-member ''Lok Sabha'' is directly elected by popular vote for a five-year term, and is the determinative constituent of political power and government formation. All Indian citizens above age 18 are eligible to vote.\n\nThe executive arm consists of the President, Vice-President, and the [[Council of Ministers]] (the [[Cabinet]] being its executive committee) headed by the Prime Minister. Any minister holding a portfolio must be a member of either house of parliament. In the Indian parliamentary system, the executive is subordinate to the legislature. \n\nIndia's independent judiciary consists of the [[Supreme Court of India|Supreme Court]], headed by the [[Chief Justice of India]]. The Supreme Court has both original jurisdiction over disputes between states and the Centre, and appellate jurisdiction over the eighteen High Courts of India, and additionally, the power to declare Union and state laws null and void if in conflict with the Constitution.<ref name=\"manorama\">{{cite book | first = K.M. | last = Matthew | title = Manorama Yearbook 2003 | publisher = [[Malayala Manorama]] | year = 2006 | id = ISBN 81-89004-07-7 | pages = pg 524 }}</ref>\n\n==Politics==\n{{main|Politics of India|Foreign relations of India}}\nFor most of its independent history, India has been ruled by the [[Indian National Congress]]. The party enjoyed a parliamentary majority barring two brief periods during the 1970s and late 1980s. This rule was interrupted between 1977 to 1980, when the [[Janata Party]] coalition won the election owing to public discontent with the [[Indian Emergency|\"Emergency\"]] declared by the then Prime Minister [[Indira Gandhi]]. The [[Janata Dal]] won elections in 1989, but its government managed to hold on to power for only two years. Between 1996 and 1998, there was a period of political flux with the government being formed first by the [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] nationalist [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] followed by a left-leaning [[United Front (India)|United Front]] coalition. In 1998, the BJP formed the [[National Democratic Alliance]] (NDA) with smaller regional parties, and became the first non-Congress and coalition government to complete a full five-year term. The [[Indian general elections, 2004|2004 Indian elections]] saw the Congress party winning the largest number of seats to form a government leading the [[United Progressive Alliance]], and supported by left-parties and those opposed to the BJP.\n\nSince independence, India has maintained cordial relationships with most nations. It took a lead in the 1950s in advocating the independence of European colonies in Africa and Asia. During the [[Cold War]], India tried to maintain its neutrality and was one of the founding members of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]]. After the [[Sino-Indian War]] and the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965]], India's relationship with the [[Soviet Union]] warmed at the expense of ties with the [[United States]] and continued to remain so till the end of the Cold War. India has consistently refused to sign the [[CTBT]] and the [[NPT]] to maintain sovereignty over its nuclear program despite criticism and military sanctions. Recent overtures by the Indian government have strengthened India's relations with United States, China and Pakistan. In the economic sphere, India has close relationships with other developing nations of [[South America]], [[Asia]] and [[Africa]]. In recent years, India has played an influential role in the [[ASEAN]], [[SAARC]] and the [[WTO]]. India has been a long time supporter of the [[United Nations]], with over 55,000 [[Indian Armed Forces|Indian military]] and police personnel having served in 35 UN peace keeping operations over four continents <ref name=\"UN\">{{cite web | title = India and the United Nations | url = http://www.un.int/india/india_and_the_un_pkeeping.html | accessdate = April 22 | accessyear = 2006}}</ref>.\n\n==Administrative divisions==\n{{main|States and territories of India}}\n{{India states}}\nAdministratively, India is divided into twenty-nine states (which are further subdivided into [[districts of India|districts]]), and six [[union territories]] (or territories owned by the Central Government). All states and the Union Territories of Delhi and Puducherry have elected governments. The remaining union territories have centrally-appointed administrators. The states and territories are further divided into 602 districts.\n\n{{See also|List of Indian districts}}\n\n==Geography==\n{{main|Geography of India}}\n[[Image:India topo big.jpg|thumb|200px|Elevated regions in India.]] \nThe territory of India constitutes a major portion of the [[Indian subcontinent]], situated on the [[Indian Plate]], the northerly portion of the [[Indo-Australian Plate]], in [[southern Asia]]. India's northern and northeastern states are partially situated in the [[Himalaya|Himalayan Mountain Range]]. The rest of northern, central and eastern India consists of the fertile [[Indo-Gangetic plain]]. In the west, bordering southeast [[Pakistan]], lies the [[Thar Desert]]. The [[South India|southern Indian]] [[Peninsula]] is almost entirely composed of the [[Deccan|Deccan plateau]], which is flanked by two hilly coastal ranges, the [[Western Ghats]] and [[Eastern Ghats]].\n\nIndia is home to several major rivers, including the [[Ganges|Ganga]], [[Brahmaputra]], [[Yamuna]], [[Godavari]], [[Kaveri]], [[Narmada]], and [[Krishna River|Krishna]]. India has three archipelagos &ndash; [[Lakshadweep]] off the southwest coast, the [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands]]-volcanic island chain to the southeast, and the [[Sunderbans]] in the Gangetic delta in West Bengal.\n\nClimate in India varies from [[tropical climate|tropical]] in the south to more [[temperate climate|temperate]] in the Himalayan north, with elevated regions in the north receiving sustained snowfall in winters. India's climate is strongly influenced by the Himalayas and the Thar Desert. The Himalayas, along with the [[Hindu Kush]] mountains in Pakistan, provide a barrier to the cold winds from Central Asia. This keeps most of the Indian subcontinent warmer than most locations in similar latitudes. The [[Thar Desert]] is responsible for attracting the moisture laden [[southwest monsoon]] winds that provide most of India's rainfall between June and September.\n\n{{see also|Climate of India|Ecoregions of India|Geology of India}}\n\n==Economy==\n{{main|Economy of India}}\n[[image:Bombay-Stock-Exchange.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The [[Bombay Stock Exchange]] index reflects investor confidence in the [[economy of India]].]]\nThe economy of India is the [[List of countries by GDP (PPP)|fourth largest]] in the world as measured by [[purchasing power parity]] (PPP), with a [[Gross Domestic Product|GDP]] of US $3.63 [[trillion]].

Starting from 1991, India has gradually opened up its markets through [[liberalization|economic reforms]] by reducing government controls on foreign trade and investment. [[Privatization|Privatisation]] of public-owned industries and some sectors to private and foreign players has continued amid political debate.\n\nIndia has a [[labour force]] of 496.4 million of which 60% is employed in agriculture or agriculture-related industries which contributes to only about 22% of the GDP, 17% in mainstream industry and 23% in service industries. India's agricultural produce includes rice, wheat, oilseed, cotton, jute, tea, sugarcane, potatoes. Major industries include textiles, chemicals, food processing, steel, transportation equipment, cement, mining, petroleum and machinery.<ref name=\"CIA\"/>\n\nIndia's large [[English language|English]] speaking middle-class has contributed to the country's growth in [[Business Process Outsourcing]] (BPO). It is becoming a major base for US tech companies for future targeted research and development, including the likes of Google, IBM, and Microsoft. All this has helped the services sector to increase its share of the economy to approximately 50%.\n\nIndia is also a major exporter of [[financial]], [[research]] and technology services. India's most important trading partners are the [[United States]], [[People's Republic of China|China]], [[United Kingdom|UK]], [[Singapore]], [[Hong Kong]], the [[United Arab Emirates]], [[Switzerland]] and [[Belgium]].<ref name=\"CIA\"/>\n\nDue to its rapidly developing economy, India has achieved numerous improvements in its transport infrastructure,  such as the [[Kolkata Metro]], Asia's fifth rapid transport system which was constructed by innovative engineering techniques uniquely applicable to the topography of the region<ref>[http://www.kolmetro.com/features/technical.html Metro Railway, Kolkata]</ref>, as well as the [[Delhi Mass Rapid Transit System]], the [[Mumbai-Pune Expressway]], the first six lane controlled expressway in South Asia, and similar projects under construction in [[Mumbai Metro|Mumbai]], [[Bangalore Metro|Bangalore]], and [[MMTS Hyderabad|Hyderabad]].\n\n\n\n==Demographics==\n{{main|Demographics of India}}\n<!--Warning!

Many cultural practices, languages, customs and monuments are examples of this co-mingling over centuries. Famous monuments, such as the [[Taj Mahal]] and other examples of [[Islamic architecture|Islamic-inspired architecture]] have been inherited from the Mughal dynasty. These are the result of a syncretic tradition that combined elements from all parts of the country.\n\n[[Image:Thanjavur_temple.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The magnificent [[Brihadisvara Temple]], built 1000 years ago.]]\n[[Music of India|Indian music]] is represented in a wide variety of forms. The two main forms of [[Indian classical music|classical music]] are [[Carnatic music|''Carnatic'']] from [[South India]], and [[Hindustani classical music|''Hindustani'']] from [[North India]], each of which has several popular sub classes. Popular forms of music also prevail, the most notable being [[Filmi music]] and [[Bhangra]] music. In addition to this are the diverse traditions of [[Indian folk music|folk music]] from different parts of the country. Many [[Indian classical dance|classical dance forms]] exist, including the [[Bharatanatyam]], [[Kathakali]], [[Kathak]], [[Kuchipudi]], [[Odissi]], and [[Manipuri dance|Manipuri]]. They often have a narrative form and are usually infused with devotional and spiritual elements.\n\nThe earliest [[Indian literature|literary traditions]] in India were mostly oral, and were later transcribed. Most of these are represented by sacred works like the [[Vedas]] and the epics of the [[Mahabharata]] and [[Ramayana]]. [[Sangam]] literature from Tamil Nadu represents some of India's oldest traditions. There have been many notable modern Indian writers, both in Indian languages and [[Indian Writing in English|in English]]. Millions of ancient handwritten manuscripts have been identified and classified. India's only [[Nobel Prize for Literature|Nobel laureate in literature]] was the [[Bengali language|Bengali]] writer [[Rabindranath Tagore]]. India is the third largest newspaper market in Asia with an estimated circulation of at least 66 million copies daily in 2003.\n\nThe nation also produces the [[Cinema of India|world's largest number of motion pictures]] every year.  Most cinema productions are based in Mumbai, Noida, Chennai and Hyderabad. Popular cinema industries are based on regional languages such as [[Hindi]], [[Punjabi]], [[Urdu]], [[Telugu language|Telugu]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Malayalam language|Malayalam]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]], and [[Kannada language|Kannada]] languages.\nThe growing film industry is backed by film schools. The world famous [[Asian Academy Of Film & Television]] attracts students from 65 countries across the globe, making India a hub for film education.\n \n[[Image:Babasteve-View_of_Varanasi_from_the_Ganges.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Varanasi]], the religious and cultural center of India for thousands of years is the oldest living city in the world and is considered as one of the most sacred places of [[pilgrimage]] for [[Hindus]] irrespective of denomination.<ref name=Varanasicity>[http://www.highbeam.com/doc.aspx?DOCID=1P1:79293885&num=4&ctrlInfo=Round20%3AMode20b%3ADocG%3AResult&ao=&FreePremium=BOTH \"Oldest Holy city\"]</ref>]]\n\nReligious practices of various faiths are an integral part of everyday life in society. The largest religion in India is [[Hinduism]]. Significant minority religions include [[Islam]], [[Jainism]], [[Sikhism]], and [[Christianity]]. Religion in India is a very public affair, with many practices imbued with pomp and vitality accompanying their underlying spiritual qualities. \n\nEducation is highly regarded by members of every socio-economic stratum. Traditional Indian family values are highly respected, and considered sacred, although urban families have grown to prefer a nuclear family system, owing to the socio-economic constraints imposed by the traditional [[joint family]] system.\n\nThe [[cuisine of India]] is  diverse, as ingredients, spices and cooking methods vary from region to region. Rice and wheat are the staple foods in the country. The country is notable for its wide variety of [[vegetarian]] and non-vegetarian [[wikibooks:Cookbook:Cuisine of India|cuisine]]. Spicy food and sweets are popular in India. [[Indian Dress|Traditional dress]] in India greatly varies across the regions in its colours and styles, and depend on various factors, including climate. Popular styles of dress include the traditional [[sari]] for women and the traditional [[dhoti]] for men.\n\nIndia's national sport is [[field hockey]], although [[cricket]] is now the ''de facto'' national game. In some states, particularly in the northeast, [[football (soccer)]] is the most popular sport and is widely watched. In recent times, [[tennis]] has gained popularity in India. [[Chess]] is also gaining popularity with the rise of the number of recognised [[International Grandmaster|grandmasters]]. The most commonly held view is that chess originated in India<ref>[http://chess.about.com/od/history/p/aa06a14.htm]</ref>. Traditional indigenous sports include [[kabaddi]]<ref name=\"rediff\">{{cite web | title = India pitches for Olympic kabbadi | work = Rediff.com | url = http://www.rediff.com/sports/2000/aug/30india.htm | accessdate = April 15 | accessyear = 2006}}</ref>, [[Kho Kho]] and [[gilli-danda]], which are played in most parts of the country.\n\nIndia is also known as a land of festivals. A melting pot of many religions, India has a rich diversity of [[Indian festivals|festivals]], many of which are celebrated irrespective of caste and creed. The most widely known and popular festivals include the Hindu festivals of [[Diwali]] and [[Holi]], the Sikh festival of [[Vaisakhi]] and the Muslim festivals of [[Eid ul-Fitr]] and [[Eid ul-Adha]]. A number of festivals are common to most parts of India; however, they may be called by different names in the various parts of the country or may be celebrated in a different fashion and style.\n\n==See also==\n{{Topics related to India}}\n{{India ties}}\n\n==References==\n<div class=\"references-small\" style=\"-moz-column-count:3; column-count:3;\">\n<references/>\n</div>\n\n==External links==\n{{Spoken Wikipedia|India.ogg|2006-03-07}}\n{{portal}}\n{{sisterlinks|India}}\n<!--PLEASE ADD SITES RELATING TO INDIA AS A WHOLE.
