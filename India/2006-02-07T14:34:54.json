It has a coastline of over seven thousand kilometres,{{inote|see Indian embassy|i-1}} borders [[Pakistan]] to the west, the [[People's Republic of China]], [[Nepal]], and [[Bhutan]] to the northeast, and [[Bangladesh]] and [[Myanmar]] to the east. On the [[Indian Ocean]], it is adjacent to three [[island nation]]s \u2014 the [[Maldives]] to the southwest, [[Sri Lanka]] to the south, and [[Indonesia]] to the southeast. India also claims a border with [[Afghanistan]] to the northwest.{{mn|afgh|1}}\n\nThe name ''India'' {{IPA2|'\u026andi\u0259}} is derived from the [[Old Persian]] version of ''[[Sindhu]]'', the historic local name for the [[Indus river]] (see [[Origin of India's name]]).

game due to its success and popularity in recent times. But cricket is not the most popular sport in quite a few states, particularly in the northeast. [[Chess]] is another international sport in which India is quite strong: [[Viswanathan Anand]] was [[FIDE]] World Champion, and several players have made significant inroads in recent years, well past the [[International Grandmaster|Grandmaster]] level. India also has a tradition of cue sports ([[snooker]], [[billiards]], etc) and shooting.\n\nIndia has had relatively little success in other international events like the [[Olympics]], where it garnered just one silver medal and two bronze medals in the previous three outings. However, it had won eight [[field hockey]] golds until 1980. India has done rather well in [[Davis Cup]] [[tennis]] tournaments, reaching the finals on three occasions. Its players have secured several individual titles and [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] doubles wins, but an Indian is yet to win a Grand Slam singles.\n\nTraditional indigenous sports include [[polo]], [[kabaddi]], [[Kho Kho]] and [[gilli-danda]], which are played in most parts of the country. Chess, [[badminton]] and [[carrom]] are also said to have originated in India. Snooker and badminton have seen Indians achieve some international success. [[Football (soccer)]] is also widely watched in almost the entire country, and is the most popular sport in many states. [[Formula 1]] racing is also increasing in popularity, due to racing driver [[Narain Karthikeyan]], though its reach is largely limited to urban areas.\n\nMaulik Khamar Says This Country is Very Cheap

This state borders a part of [[Afghanistan]]. A ceasefire sponsored by the [[United Nations]] in 1948 freezes the positions of Indian and Pakistani held territory. As a consequence, the region bordering Afghanistan is in Pakistani-administered territory.\n*{{mnb|LoC|2}} The black line is the boundary as recognised by the government of India. The northern region of [[Kashmir]] is currently administered by India, Pakistan, and China (and coloured in as such). The delimiting of the three administered regions is ''not'' the international boundary but a ceasefire line demarcated in red. The boundary separating India and Pakistan is known as the [[Line of Control]], that separating India and China as the '[[Line of Actual Control]]'. Most of the state of [[Arunachal Pradesh]] has been formerly claimed by China.\n\n----\n* '''India''' is also the letter '''[[I]]''' in the [[NATO phonetic alphabet]].\n\n{{India ties}}\n{{Life in India}}\n\n{{featured article}}\n\n[[Category:India|*]]\n[[Category:Republics]]\n[[Category:Members of the Commonwealth of Nations]]\n[[Category:SAARC members]]\n[[Category:Former British colonies]]\n\n{{Link FA|sv}}\n\n{{Link FA|sv}}\n\n[[af:Indi\u00eb]]\n[[als:Indien]]\n[[ang:India]]\n[[ar:\u0647\u0646\u062f]]\n[[an:India]]\n[[as:\u09ad\u09be\u09b0\u09a4]]\n[[ast:India]]\n[[ay:India]]\n[[bg:\u0418\u043d\u0434\u0438\u044f]]\n[[zh-min-nan:\u00ccn-t\u014d\u00b7]]\n[[be:\u0406\u043d\u0434\u044b\u044f]]\n[[bn:\u09ad\u09be\u09b0\u09a4]]\n[[bh:\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924]]\n[[bs:Indija]]\n[[br:India]]\n[[ca:\u00cdndia]]\n[[cv:\u0418\u043d\u0434\u0438]]\n[[chr:India]]\n[[co:India]]\n[[cs:Indie]]\n[[cy:India]]\n[[da:Indien]]\n[[de:Indien]]\n[[et:India]]\n[[el:\u0399\u03bd\u03b4\u03af\u03b1]]\n[[es:India]]\n[[eo:Barato]]\n[[eu:India]]\n[[fa:\u0647\u0646\u062f]]\n[[fo:India]]\n[[fr:Inde]]\n[[fy:Yndia]]\n[[fur:Indie]]\n[[ga:An India]]\n[[gd:Na h-Innseachan]]\n[[gl:India - \u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924]]\n[[got:\ud800\udf39\ud800\udf3d\ud800\udf33\ud800\udf39\ud800\udf30]]\n[[gn:India]]\n[[gu:\u0aad\u0abe\u0ab0\u0aa4]]\n[[ko:\uc778\ub514\uc544]]\n[[ht:End]]\n[[haw:\u02bbInia]]\n[[hy:\u0540\u0576\u0564\u056f\u0561\u057d\u057f\u0561\u0576]]\n[[hi:\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924]]\n[[hr:Indija]]\n[[io:India]]\n[[id:India]]\n[[ia:India]]\n[[iu:\u1403\u14d0\u144e\u140a]]\n[[is:Indland]]\n[[it:India]]\n[[he:\u05d4\u05d5\u05d3\u05d5]]\n[[jv:India]]\n[[kn:\u0cad\u0cbe\u0cb0\u0ca4]]\n[[ka:\u10d8\u10dc\u10d3\u10dd\u10d4\u10d7\u10d8]]\n[[kk:\u04ae\u043d\u0434\u0456\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d]]\n[[csb:Indie]]\n[[ks:\u06c1\u0650\u0646\u062f\u0648\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646]]\n[[kw:Eynda]]\n[[km:\u17a5\u178e\u17d2\u178c\u17b6]]\n[[sw:Uhindi]]\n[[ku:Hindistan]]\n[[la:India]]\n[[lv:Indija]]\n[[lt:Indija]]\n[[lb:Indien]]\n[[li:India]]\n[[jbo:barat]]\n[[hu:India]]\n[[mk:\u0418\u043d\u0434\u0438\u0458\u0430]]\n[[ml:\u0d07\u0d28\u0d4d\u0d24\u0d4d\u0d2f]]\n[[mt:Indja]]\n[[mi:Inia (whenua)]]\n[[mr:\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924]]\n[[ms:India]]\n[[nah:India]]\n[[na:India]]\n[[nl:India]]\n[[cr:India]]\n[[ne:\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924]]\n[[nds:Indien]]\n[[ja:\u30a4\u30f3\u30c9]]\n[[nap:Innia]]\n[[no:India]]\n[[nn:India]]\n[[oc:\u00cdndia]]\n[[or:\u0b2d\u0b3e\u0b30\u0b24]]\n[[os:\u0418\u043d\u0434\u0438]]\n[[ps:\u0647\u0646\u062f]]\n[[pl:Indie]]\n[[pt:\u00cdndia]]\n[[pa:\u0a2d\u0a3e\u0a30\u0a24]]\n[[ro:India]]\n[[rm:India]]\n[[qu:Indiya]]\n[[ru:\u0418\u043d\u0434\u0438\u044f]]\n[[se:India]]\n[[sa:\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924]]\n[[sc:\u00ccndia]]\n[[sq:India]]\n[[sh:Indija]]\n[[scn:India]]\n[[simple:India]]\n[[sd:\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924]]\n[[sk:India]]\n[[sl:Indija]]\n[[sr:\u0418\u043d\u0434\u0438\u0458\u0430]]\n[[su:India]]\n[[fi:Intia]]\n[[sv:Indien]]\n[[tl:Indya]]\n[[tg:\u04b2\u0438\u043d\u0434\u0443\u0441\u0442\u043e\u043d]]\n[[ta:\u0b87\u0ba8\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0bbf\u0baf\u0bbe]]\n[[tt:Hindstan]]\n[[te:\u0c2d\u0c3e\u0c30\u0c24 \u0c26\u0c47\u0c36\u0c2e\u0c41]]\n[[th:\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e30\u0e40\u0e17\u0e28\u0e2d\u0e34\u0e19\u0e40\u0e14\u0e35\u0e22]]\n[[vi:\u1ea4n \u0110\u1ed9]]\n[[tpi:India]]\n[[tr:Hindistan]]\n[[uk:\u0406\u043d\u0434\u0456\u044f]]\n[[ur:\u0628\u06be\u0627\u0631\u062a]]\n[[uz:Hindiston]]\n[[wa:Inde]]\n[[yi:\u05d0\u05d9\u05e0\u05d3\u05d9\u05b4\u05d9\u05e2]]\n[[yo:India]]\n[[zh:\u5370\u5ea6]]"
