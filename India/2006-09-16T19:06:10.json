India is adjacent to the [[Indian Ocean]] [[island nation]]s of [[Sri Lanka]], [[Maldives]] and [[Indonesia]].\n\nHome to the [[Indus Valley Civilization|Indus Valley Civilisation]], a centre of important trade routes and vast empires, India has long played a major role in human history. [[Hinduism]], [[Sikhism]], [[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]] all have their origins in India, while [[Islam]], [[Judaism]] and [[Christianity]] enjoy a strong cultural heritage having arrived through trade even before foreign invasions, and having reached the subcontinent before European occupation of the region. Colonised as part of the [[British Empire]] in the nineteenth century, India gained independence in 1947 as a unified nation after an intense [[Indian independence movement|struggle for independence]]. The country's population, wildlife, geographical terrain and climate system are among the most diverse in the world.\n\n==Etymology==\n{{main|Origin of India's name}}\nThe name ''India'' /{{IPA|'\u026andi\u0259}}/ is derived from ''[[Indus River|Indus]]'', which is derived from the [[Old Persian]] word ''[[Hindu]]'', from [[Sanskrit]] ''[[Sindhu]]'', the historic local appellation for the [[Indus River]]. The [[Constitution of India]] and common usage recognise '''Bharat''' ({{IPAudio|Bharat.ogg|/b\u02b1a\u02d0r\u0259t\u032a/ }}), as an official name, India is also recognized with equal status. A third name, ''[[Hindustan]]''{{inote|THIS SPELLING IS CORRECT. PLEASE READ [[Wikipedia:text support for Indic scripts]]|Indic support}} ({{IPAudio|Hindustan.ogg|/\u0266\u026an\u032ad\u032a\u028ast\u032aa\u02d0n/ }}) ([[Persian language|Persian]]: ''[[stan|Land]] of the Hindus'') {{inote|ref:Webster's New World Dictionary|Indus}} has been used since the twelfth century, although its contemporary use is unevenly applied.\n\n==History==\n<!-- THIS SECTION IS A SUMMARY. CONSIDER ADDING MATERIAL TO THE 'HISTORY OF INDIA' ARTICLE.-->\n{{main|History of India}}\n\n[[Stone Age]] rock shelters with paintings at [[Bhimbetka]] in the state of [[Madhya Pradesh]] are the earliest known traces of human life in India. The first known permanent settlements appeared over 9,000 years ago and gradually developed into the [[Indus Valley Civilization]], dating back to 3300 BCE in western India. It was followed by the [[Vedic Civilization]] which laid the foundations of [[Hinduism]] and other cultural aspects of early Indian society. From around 550 BCE, many independent kingdoms and republics known as the [[Mahajanapadas]] were established across the country laying the foundations of ancient India.\n\nThe empire built by the [[Maurya dynasty]] under Emperor [[Ashoka|Ashoka the Great]] united most of modern [[South Asia|Southern Asia]] except the [[Dravidian people|Dravidian]] kingdoms in the south. From 180 BCE, a series of invasions from [[Central Asia]] followed including the [[Indo-Greek]]s, [[Indo-Scythian]]s, [[Indo-Parthian]]s, [[Arabs]], [[Afghans]] and [[Kushan Empire|Kushans]] in the north-western [[Indian Subcontinent]]. From the third century CE, the [[Gupta Empire|Gupta dynasty]] oversaw the period referred to as ancient India's \"Golden Age.\" While the north had larger, fewer kingdoms, in the south there were several dynasties such as the [[Chalukyas]], [[Rashtrakutas]], [[Hoysalas]], [[Cheras]], [[Cholas]], [[Pallavas]] and [[Pandyas]] in different times and regions. The political influence of these mighty southern kingdoms, though felt to a lesser extent by north India, extended into [[Southeast Asia]] and [[Sri Lanka]] and deeply influenced their culture. The southern kingdoms remained relatively more stable and carried out maritime trade in spices and precious gems with the Arabia, China and Europe from ancient times. [[Ancient Indian science and technology|Science, engineering]], [[Indian art|art]], [[Indian literature|literature]], [[Indian Mathematics|mathematics]], [[Indian science|astronomy]], [[Religion in India|religion]] and [[Indian philosophy|philosophy]] flourished under the patronage of these kings.\n[[Image:Sanchi2.jpg|thumb|left|270px|The [[Sanchi|Sanchi stupa]] in Sanchi, [[Madhya Pradesh]] built by emperor Ashoka in the 3rd century BC]]\n\nFollowing the invasions from Central Asia, between the tenth to the twelfth centuries, much of north India came under the rule of the [[Delhi Sultanate]], and later the [[Mughal dynasty]], who gradually expanded their reign through most of the Indian subcontinent. Nevertheless, several indigenous kingdoms flourished, especially in the south, such as the [[Vijayanagara Empire]]. From the sixteenth century onwards, several [[Europe|European]] countries, including [[Portugal]], [[Netherlands]], [[France]] and the [[United Kingdom]], started arriving as traders, later taking advantage of the fractious nature of relations between the kingdoms, to establish [[colony|colonies]] in the country. By 1856, most of India came under control of the [[British East India Company]]. A year later, a failed nationwide insurrection of rebelling military units and kingdoms, known locally as the [[Indian rebellion of 1857|First War of Indian Independence]] (known as the Sepoy Mutiny elsewhere) broke out, leading to India being under the direct control of the [[British Crown]] as a colony of the British Empire.\n[[Image:Nehru Gandhi 1937 touchup.jpg|thumb|270px|right|[[Mahatma Gandhi]] (right) with India's first Prime Minister, [[Jawaharlal Nehru]]]]\n\nIn the early twentieth century, a nationwide [[Indian Independence Movement|struggle for independence]] was launched by the [[Indian National Congress]], and various revolutionary groups. The movement was largely led by [[Mahatma Gandhi]], with [[Maulana Azad]], [[Gopal Krishna Gokhale]], [[Lala Lajpat Rai]], [[Bal Gangadhar Tilak]], [[Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel]], [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], [[Bipin Chandra Pal]] and [[Subhash Chandra Bose]] playing important roles. Millions protested in various mass campaigns of [[civil disobedience]] with a commitment to ''[[ahimsa]]'' or non-violence. Finally, after the [[Quit India|''Quit India'' massive civil disobedience]] movement during [[World War II|WWII]], and a number of [[Bombay Mutiny|mutinies]] in the armed forces after the war, India gained independence from British rule on [[15 August]] [[1947]]. Three years later, on [[26 January]], [[1950]], India ratified a new [[Constitution of India|Constitution]], and became a republic.\n\nSince it gained independence, India has seen sectarian violence and [[insurgency|insurgencies]] in various parts of the country, but has maintained its unity and democracy. It has unresolved territorial disputes with China, which escalated into the brief [[Sino-Indian War]] in 1962; and with Pakistan, which resulted in wars in [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1947|1947]], [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965|1965]], [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971|1971]] and in 1999 war in [[Kargil War|Kargil]]. India is a founding member of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] and the [[United Nations]] (at the time as part of British India). In 1974, India conducted an underground [[Smiling Buddha|nuclear test]]. This was followed by [[Operation Shakti|five more]] tests in 1998. Significant economic reforms beginning in 1991 have transformed India into one of the fastest-growing economies in the world.\n\n{{see also|Timeline of Indian history|Military history of India|Indian Independence Movement}}\n\n==Government==\n{{main|Government of India}}\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 0.75em; margin-bottom: 0.5em; padding: 0.5em; width:220px; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\"\n|+ '''National symbols of India'''\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left: 1em;\" | '''Flag'''\n| [[Tiranga]]                                                \n|-\n| style=\"padding-left: 1em;\" | '''Emblem'''\n| [[Emblem of India|Sarnath Lion]]\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left: 1em;\" | '''Anthem'''\n| \"[[Jana Gana Mana]]\"\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left: 1em;\" | '''Song'''\n| \"[[Vande Mataram|Vand\u0113 M\u0101taram]]\"\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left: 1em;\" | '''Animal'''\n| [[Bengal Tiger|Royal Bengal Tiger]]\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left: 1em;\" | '''Bird'''\n| [[Indian Peacock]]\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left: 1em;\" | '''Flower'''\n| [[Nelumbo nucifera|Lotus]]\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left: 1em;\" | '''Tree'''\n| [[Banyan]]\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left: 1em;\" | '''Fruit'''\n| [[Mango]]\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left: 1em;\" | '''Sport'''\n| [[Field Hockey]]\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left: 1em;\" | '''Calendar'''\n| [[Indian National Calendar|Saka]]\n|\n|}\n\nIndia is referred to as the largest democracy in the world, by virtue of the fact that it has the largest [[electorate|electing population]] among [[List of democratic states|democratic countries]].
