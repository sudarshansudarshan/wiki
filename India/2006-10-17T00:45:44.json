Hinduism, Sikhism, Buddhism and Jainism all have their origins in India, while Islam, Judaism and Christianity enjoy a strong cultural heritage having arrived through trade even before foreign invasions, and having reached the subcontinent before European occupation of the region. Colonised as part of the British Empire in the nineteenth century, India gained independence in 1947 as a unified nation after an intense struggle for independence. The country's culture, population, wildlife, geographical terrain and climate system are among the most diverse in the world.\n\n==Etymology==\n{{main|Origin of India's name}}\nThe name ''India'' /{{IPA|'\u026andi\u0259}}/ is derived from ''[[Indus River|Indus]]'', which is derived from the [[Old Persian]] word ''[[Hindu]]'', from [[Sanskrit]] ''[[Sindhu]]'', the historic local appellation for the [[Indus River]]. The [[Constitution of India]] and common usage recognise '''Bharat''' ({{IPAudio|Bharat.ogg|/b\u02b1a\u02d0r\u0259t\u032a/ }}), as an official name; India is also recognized with equal status. A third name, ''[[Hindustan]]''{{inote|THIS SPELLING IS CORRECT.

In ancient times, India was also known by the name ''Hind'', a shortened form of ''Hindustan''.\n\n==History==\n<!-- THIS SECTION IS A SUMMARY. CONSIDER ADDING MATERIAL TO THE 'HISTORY OF INDIA' ARTICLE.-->\n{{main|History of India}}\n[[South Asian Stone Age|Stone Age]] rock shelters with paintings at [[Bhimbetka]] in the state of [[Madhya Pradesh]] are the earliest known traces of human life in India. The first known permanent settlements appeared over 9,000 years ago and gradually developed into the [[Indus Valley Civilization]], dating back to 3300 BCE in western India. It was followed by the [[Vedic Civilization]] which laid the foundations of [[Hinduism]] and other cultural aspects of early Indian society. From around 550 BCE, many independent kingdoms and republics known as the [[Mahajanapadas]] were established across the country laying the foundations of ancient India.\n\nThe empire built by the [[Maurya dynasty]] under Emperor [[Ashoka|Ashoka the Great]] united most of modern [[South Asia|Southern Asia]] except the [[Dravidian people|Dravidian]] kingdoms in the south. From 180 BCE, a series of invasions from [[Central Asia]] into the north-western [[Indian Subcontinent]] followed, including the [[Indo-Greek]]s, [[Indo-Scythian]]s, [[Indo-Parthian]]s and the [[Kushan Empire|Kushans]]. From the third century CE, the [[Gupta Empire|Gupta dynasty]] oversaw the period referred to as ancient India's \"Golden Age.\" While the north had larger, fewer kingdoms, in the south there were several dynasties such as the [[Chalukyas]], [[Rashtrakutas]], [[Hoysalas]], [[Cheras]], [[Cholas]], [[Pallavas]] and [[Pandyas]] in different times and regions. The political influence of these mighty southern kingdoms, though felt to a lesser extent by north India, extended into [[Southeast Asia]] and [[Sri Lanka]] and deeply influenced their culture. The southern kingdoms remained by comparison more stable, and were able to carry out maritime trade in spices and precious gems with Arabia, China and Europe in ancient times. [[Ancient Indian science and technology|Science, engineering]], [[Indian art|art]], [[Indian literature|literature]], [[Indian Mathematics|mathematics]], [[Indian science|astronomy]], [[Religion in India|religion]] and [[Indian philosophy|philosophy]] flourished under the patronage of these kings.\n[[Image:Sanchi2.jpg|thumb|left|270px|The [[Sanchi|Sanchi stupa]] in Sanchi, [[Madhya Pradesh]] built by emperor Ashoka in the 3rd century BC]]\n\nFollowing the invasions from Central Asia, between the tenth to the twelfth centuries, much of north India came under the rule of the [[Delhi Sultanate]], and later the [[Mughal dynasty]], who gradually expanded their reign through most of the Indian subcontinent. Nevertheless, several indigenous kingdoms flourished, in the west and the south, such as the [[Maratha Empire]] and [[Vijayanagara Empire]]. From the sixteenth century onwards, several [[Europe|European]] countries, including [[Portugal]], [[Netherlands]], [[France]] and the [[United Kingdom]], started arriving as traders, and attempted to establish [[colony|colonies]] in the subcontinent, taking advantage of the fractious nature of relations between thousands of kingdoms. By 1856, the [[British East India Company]] by signing commercial treaties with the myriad kingdoms, tried to unite the subcontinent in an attempt to make it a single large territory under them. A year later, a nationwide insurrection of rebelling military units and kingdoms, known as the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857|Rebellion of 1857]] broke out. This shook the British East India Company, however, the lack of an organized leadership weakened the rebellion, and inspired the British to take more power. The British again started the process of uniting the territories and even appointed non-native symbolic Governor-Generals, who, in reality, were subject to the capriciousness of the Indian kings and nobles. Over the next few decades, many Indian kings and nobles cleverly used those non-native symbolic Governor-Generals for a western-style industrial development of their respective myriad territories. A western-style bureaucracy was raised with trained Indian people. It was during this time that the railways, telegraph and posts, military camps (cantonments) western-style educational institutes, and other industries were established. By this time the British realized that all these territories could be directly brought under the direct control of their empire. However, both the [[World Wars]] weakened Britain. And the Indian populace, after having imbibed western-style industrial development and its advantages, now decided to expel all non-natives, as well as, take advantage of a unified territory to forge it into a large powerful democratic nation. Some historians also point out that during the last decades of 19th century, the numerous Indian nobles cunningly and knowingly gave the British a free-hand for rapid development, with the historical knowledge, that finally the non-natives will be thrown away or completely absorbed.{{fact}}\n\n[[Image:Nehru Gandhi 1937 touchup.jpg|thumb|270px|right|[[Mahatma Gandhi]] (right) with India's first Prime Minister, [[Jawaharlal Nehru]]]]\n\nBy the early twentieth century, a nationwide [[Indian Independence Movement|movement for social reforms, expulsion of non-natives, and full native governance]] was launched by the [[Indian National Congress]], and various revolutionary groups. The movement was largely led by [[Mahatma Gandhi]], with [[Maulana Azad]], [[Gopal Krishna Gokhale]], [[Lala Lajpat Rai]], [[Bal Gangadhar Tilak]], [[Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel]], [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], [[Bipin Chandra Pal]] and [[Subhash Chandra Bose]] playing important roles. Millions protested in various mass campaigns of [[civil disobedience]] with a commitment to ''[[ahimsa]]'' or non-violence. There were also armed revolts throughout this period where numerous Indians like the [[Udham Singh]], [[Bhagat Singh]], [[Sukhdev]], [[Rajguru]] and an army of Indian soldiers under Netaji [[Subhash Chandra Bose]] used [[revolutionary]] or [[military]] means. Finally, after the [[Quit India|''Quit India'' massive civil disobedience]] movement during [[World War II|WWII]], and a number of [[Bombay Mutiny|mutinies]] in the armed forces after the war, India expelled all the non-natives and emerged as a modern democratic nation-state on [[15 August]] [[1947]]. This period also sowed the seeds of another nation - [[Pakistan]], and after a blood-stained partition, the [[Muslim]] majority regions were carved out to form [[Pakistan]]. Three years later, on [[26 January]], [[1950]], India ratified a new [[Constitution of India|Constitution]], and became a republic.\n\nSince it became a modern democratic nation-state, India has seen violence and [[insurgency|insurgencies]] in various parts of the country, but has maintained its unity and democracy. It has unresolved territorial disputes with China, which escalated into the brief [[Sino-Indian War]] in 1962; and with Pakistan, which resulted in wars in [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1947|1947]], [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965|1965]], [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971|1971]] and in 1999 war in [[Kargil War|Kargil]]. India is a founding member of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] and the [[United Nations]]. In 1974, India conducted an underground [[Smiling Buddha|nuclear test]]. This was followed by [[Operation Shakti|five more]] tests in 1998. Significant economic reforms beginning in 1991 have transformed India into one of the fastest-growing economies in the world.\n\n{{see also|Timeline of Indian history|Military history of India|Indian Independence Movement}}\n\n==Government==\n{{main|Government of India}}\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 0.75em; margin-bottom: 0.5em; padding: 0.5em; width:220px; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\"\n|+ '''National symbols of India'''\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left: 1em;\" | '''Flag'''\n| [[Tiranga]]                                                \n|-\n| style=\"padding-left: 1em;\" | '''Emblem'''\n| [[Emblem of India|Sarnath Lion]]\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left: 1em;\" | '''Anthem'''\n| \"[[Jana Gana Mana]]\"\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left: 1em;\" | '''Song'''\n| \"[[Vande Mataram|Vand\u0113 M\u0101taram]]\"\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left: 1em;\" | '''Animal'''\n| [[Bengal Tiger|Royal Bengal Tiger]]\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left: 1em;\" | '''Bird'''\n| [[Indian Peacock]]\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left: 1em;\" | '''Flower'''\n| [[Nelumbo nucifera|Lotus]]\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left: 1em;\" | '''Tree'''\n| [[Banyan]]\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left: 1em;\" | '''Fruit'''\n| [[Mango]]\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left: 1em;\" | '''Sport'''\n| [[Field Hockey]]\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left: 1em;\" | '''Calendar'''\n| [[Indian National Calendar|Saka]]\n|\n|}\n\nIndia is referred to as the largest democracy in the world, by virtue of the fact that it has the largest [[electorate|electing population]] among [[List of democratic states|democratic countries]]. The country has a federal form of government and a [[bicameral]] [[parliament]] operating under a [[Westminster System|Westminster-style]] parliamentary system. It has three branches of governance: the [[Legislature]], [[executive (government)|Executive]] and [[Judiciary]]. The [[President of India|President]] is the [[head of state]], though he has a largely ceremonial role to play. He is also the Supreme Commander of [[Indian military|India's armed forces]]. The President is elected indirectly by an [[electoral college]] for five-year terms. Presidential assent is needed for a Bill or Ordinance passed by the Parliament to come into force. The [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Minister]] is the de facto [[head of government]], and has most executive powers. He or she is appointed by the President, with the requirement that he or she enjoy the support of the party or coalition having more than one half of the total seats in the lower house. The Union Council of Ministers headed by the Prime Minister aids and advises the President on governance matters.\n[[Image:Thesouthblockdelhi.JPG|270px|thumb|The [[Secretariat Building]] in New Delhi houses the [[Indian Prime Minister's Office|Prime Minister's Office]], the ministries of [[Ministry of Defence|Defence]], External Affairs and Finance and the Home Ministry]]\n\nThe legislature of India is the bicameral [[Indian Parliament|Parliament]], which consists of the upper house called the [[Rajya Sabha]] (Council of States), and the lower house called the [[Lok Sabha]] (House of People). The 245-member Rajya Sabha is chosen indirectly through the state Legislative Assemblies, and has a staggered six-year term. Each state sends members to the Rajya Sabha in a proportion of its population. The 545-member Lok Sabha is directly elected (Some seats are reserved for Caste based system) by popular vote for a five-year term (except two nominated Anglo-Indian members), and is the determinative constituent of political power and government formation. Universal adulthood suffrage is guaranteed by the Constitution for citizens above 18 years of age. The executive arm consists of the President, Vice-President, and the [[Council of Ministers]] (the [[Cabinet]] being its executive committee) headed by the Prime Minister. Any minister holding a portfolio must be a member of either house of parliament. In the Indian parliamentary system, the executive is subordinate to the legislature.\n\nIndia's independent judiciary consists of the [[Supreme Court of India|Supreme Court]], headed by the [[Chief Justice of India]]. The Supreme Court has both original jurisdiction over disputes between states and the Centre, and appellate jurisdiction over the eighteen [[High Courts of India]], and additionally, the power to declare Union and state laws null and void if in conflict with the Constitution.<ref name=\"manorama\">{{cite book | first = K.M. | last = Matthew | title = Manorama Yearbook 2003 | publisher = [[Malayala Manorama]] | year = 2006 | id = ISBN 81-89004-07-7 | pages = pg 524 }}</ref>\n\n==Politics==\n{{main|Politics of India|Foreign relations of India}}\n[[Image:IndiaMap2.PNG|thumb|270px|Map of India <ref name=\"loc\">The black line is the boundary as recognised by the government of India.

The boundary separating India and Pakistan is known as the [[Line of Control]], that separating India and China as the '[[Line of Actual Control]]'. Most of the state of [[Arunachal Pradesh]] is still claimed by China.</ref>]]\n\nFor most of its democratic history, India has been governed by the [[Indian National Congress]]. The party enjoyed a parliamentary majority barring two brief periods during the 1970s and late 1980s. This rule was interrupted between 1977 to 1980, when the [[Janata Party]] coalition won the election owing to public discontent with the [[Indian Emergency|\"Emergency\"]] declared by the then Prime Minister [[Indira Gandhi]]. The [[Janata Dal]] won elections in 1989, but its government managed to hold on to power for only two years. Between 1996 and 1998, there was a period of political flux with the government being formed first by the right-of-centre, nationalist [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP) followed by a left-leaning [[United Front (India)|United Front]] coalition. In 1998, the BJP formed the [[National Democratic Alliance]] (NDA) with smaller regional parties, and became tirst non-Congress and coalition government to complete a full five-year term. The [[Indian general elections, 2004|2004 Indian elections]] saw the left-leaning Congress party winning the largest number of seats to form a government by leading the [[United Progressive Alliance]], and supported by communist parties and those opposed to the BJP.\n\nSince emerging as an singular democratic nation-state, India has maintained cordial relationships with most nations. It took a lead in the 1950s in advocating the independence of European colonies in Africa and Asia. During the [[Cold War]], India tried to maintain its neutrality and was one of the founding members of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]]. After the [[Sino-Indian War]] and the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965]], India's relationship with the [[Soviet Union]] warmed at the expense of ties with the [[United States]] and continued to remain so until the end of the Cold War. India has consistently refused to sign the [[CTBT]] and the [[NPT]] to maintain sovereignty over its nuclear program despite criticism and military sanctions. Recent overtures by the Indian government have strengthened India's relations with United States, China and Pakistan. In the economic sphere, India has close relationships with other developing nations of [[South America]], [[Asia]] and [[Africa]]. In recent years, India has played an influential role in the [[SAARC]]. India has been a long time supporter of the [[United Nations]], with over 55,000 [[Indian Armed Forces|Indian military]] and police personnel having served in 35 UN peace keeping operations over four continents <ref name=\"UN\">{{cite web | title = India and the United Nations | url = http://www.un.int/india/india_and_the_un_pkeeping.html | accessdate = April 22 | accessyear = 2006}}</ref>. Since the 1990s, India has been considered an emerging power on the global stage, meaning it has increasing influence on international affairs.\n\n==Administrative divisions==\n{{main|States and territories of India}}\n\nAdministratively, India is divided into twenty-nine states (which are further subdivided into [[districts of India|districts]]), and six [[union territories]] (or territories owned by the Central Government). All states and the union territories of Delhi and Puducherry have elected governments. The remaining union territories have centrally-appointed administrators. The states and territories are further divided into 602 districts.\n\n{{India states}}\n{{See also|List of Indian districts}}\n\n==Geography==\n{{main|Geography of India}}\n[[Image:India topo big.jpg|thumb|270px|Elevated regions in India.]]\nIndia has a very varied and diverse geography. From snow clad mountains to deserts, almost every type of landscape is present in India. The territory of India constitutes a major portion of the [[Indian subcontinent]], situated on the [[Indian Plate]], the northerly portion of the [[Indo-Australian Plate]], in [[southern Asia]]. India's northern and northeastern states are partially situated in the [[Himalaya|Himalayan Mountain Range]]. The Aravali Mountains separate Thar Desert from rest of Rajasthan. The Vindhyas separate the Indo-Gangetic plains from the Deccan plateau. Satpura Ranges are also found in Central India. To the Northwestern part of Indian Kashmir few high peaks of Karakoram range are also present. World's one of the single longest glacier Siachen glacier is found in this mountain range. This glacier is 78 kilometres (48&nbsp;[[Mile|mi]]) long. The rest of northern and eastern India consists of the fertile [[Indo-Gangetic plain]]. This stretches from Punjab in Northwest to West Bengal in the east. In the west, bordering southeast [[Pakistan]], lies the [[Thar Desert]]. The [[South India|southern Indian]] [[Peninsula]] is almost entirely composed of the [[Deccan|Deccan plateau]], which is flanked by two hilly coastal mountain ranges, the [[Western Ghats]] and [[Eastern Ghats]]. The Eastern Ghats mountains are a bit lower then the Western Ghats. To the east of the Eastern Ghats is Eastern Coastal Plains and to the west of the Western Ghats is Western Coastal Plains. The Eastern Coastal Plains are more broader then Western Coastal Plains. \n\nIndia is home to several major rivers, including the [[Ganges|Ganga]], [[Brahmaputra]], [[Yamuna]], [[Godavari]], [[Kaveri]], [[Narmada]], and [[Krishna River|Krishna]]. India has three archipelagos &ndash; [[Lakshadweep]] off the southwest coast, the [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands]]-volcanic island chain to the southeast, and the [[Sunderbans]] in the Gangetic delta in West Bengal.\n\nClimate in India varies from [[tropical climate|tropical]] in the south to more [[temperate climate|temperate]] in the Himalayan north, with elevated regions in the north receiving sustained snowfall in winters. India's climate is strongly influenced by the Himalayas and the Thar Desert. The Himalayas, along with the [[Hindu Kush]] mountains in Pakistan, provide a barrier to the cold winds from Central Asia. This keeps most of the Indian subcontinent warmer than most locations in similar latitudes. The [[Thar Desert]] is responsible for attracting the moisture laden [[southwest monsoon]] winds that provide most of India's rainfall between June and September.\n\n{{see also|Climate of India|Ecoregions of India|Geology of India}}\n\n==Economy==\n{{main|Economy of India}}\n[[image:Bombay-Stock-Exchange.jpg|thumb|200px|The [[Bombay Stock Exchange]] index reflects investor confidence in the [[economy of India]].]]\nThe economy of India is the [[List of countries by GDP (PPP)|fourth largest]] in the world as measured by [[purchasing power parity]] (PPP), with a [[Gross Domestic Product|GDP]] of US $3.63 [[trillion]].

Starting from 1991, India has gradually opened up its markets through [[liberalization|economic reforms]] by reducing government controls on foreign trade and investment. [[Privatization|Privatisation]] of public-owned industries and some sectors to private and foreign players has continued amid political debate.\n\nIndia has a [[labour force]] of 496.4 million of which 60% is employed in agriculture or agriculture-related industries which contributes to only about 22% of the GDP, 17% in mainstream industry and 23% in service industries. India's agricultural produce includes rice, wheat, oilseed, cotton, jute, tea, sugarcane, potatoes. Major industries include textiles, chemicals, food processing, steel, transportation equipment, cement, mining, petroleum and machinery.<ref name=\"CIA\"/>\n\nIndia's large [[English language|English]] speaking middle-class has contributed to the country's growth in [[Business Process Outsourcing]] (BPO). It is becoming a major base for US tech companies for future targeted research & development, including the likes of Google, IBM, and Microsoft.
