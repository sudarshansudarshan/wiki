CONSIDER ADDING MATERIAL TO THE 'HISTORY OF INDIA' ARTICLE.-->\n{{main|History of India}}\n\n[[Stone Age]] rock shelters with paintings at [[Bhimbetka]] in the state of [[Madhya Pradesh]] are the earliest known traces of human life in India. The first known permanent settlements appeared over 9,000 years ago, and gradually developed into the [[Indus Valley Civilisation]], began in around 3300 BCE in western India. It was followed by the [[Vedic Civilisation]] which laid the foundations of [[Hinduism]] and other cultural aspects of early Indian society. From around 550 BCE, many independent kingdoms and republics known as the [[Mahajanapadas]] were established across the country. \n\nThe empire built by the [[Maurya dynasty]] under Emperor [[Ashoka]] united most of modern [[South Asia]], except the Tamil Kingdoms in the south. From 180 BCE, a series of invasions from [[Central Asia]] followed including the [[Indo-Greek]]s, [[Indo-Scythian]]s, [[Indo-Parthian]]s and [[Kushan Empire|Kushans]] in the northwestern [[Indian Subcontinent]]. From the third century CE, the [[Gupta|Gupta dynasty]] oversaw the period referred to as ancient India's \"Golden Age.\" In the south, several dynasties, including the [[Chalukyas]], [[Rashtrakutas]], [[Hoysalas]], [[Cheras]], [[Cholas]], [[Pallavas]] and [[Pandyas]] prevailed during different periods. [[Ancient Indian science and technology|Science, engineering]], [[Indian art|art]], [[Indian literature|literature]], [[Indian Mathematics|mathematics]], [[Indian science|astronomy]], [[Religion in India|religion]] and [[Indian philosophy|philosophy]] flourished under the patronage of these kings.\n[[Image:Sanchi2.jpg|thumb|right|270px|The [[Sanchi|Sanchi stupa]] in Sanchi, [[Madhya Pradesh]] built by emperor [[Ashoka]] in the 3rd century BC]]\nFollowing the invasions from Central Asia, between the tenth to the twelfth centuries, much of north India came under the rule of the [[Delhi Sultanate]], and later the [[Mughal dynasty]], who gradually expanded their reign throughout large parts of the Indian subcontinent. Nevertheless, several indigenous kingdoms flourished, especially in the south, like the [[Vijayanagara Empire]]. During the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, several [[Europe|European]] countries, including [[Portugal]], [[Netherlands]], [[France]] and the [[United Kingdom]], initially arrived as traders, later took advantage of the fractious nature of relations between the kingdoms, to establish [[colony|colonies]] in the country. By 1856, most of India came under control of the [[British East India Company]]. A year later, a nationwide insurrection of rebelling military units and kingdoms, known locally as the [[Indian rebellion of 1857|First War of Indian Independence]] (known as the Sepoy Mutiny elsewhere) broke out, which failed even as it seriously challenged British rule. India thus came under the direct control of the [[British Crown]] as a colony of the British Empire.\n\n[[Image:Nehru Gandhi 1937 touchup.jpg|thumb|270px|right|[[Mahatma Gandhi]] (right) with India's first Prime Minister, Pandit [[Jawaharlal Nehru]]]]\nIn the early twentieth century, a nationwide [[Indian Independence Movement|struggle for independence]] was launched by the [[Indian National Congress]], largely led by [[Mahatma Gandhi]]. Millions of protestors would engage in mass campaigns of [[civil disobedience]] with a commitment to ''[[ahimsa]]'' or non-violence. Finally, on [[15 August]], 1947, India gained independence from British rule. Three years later, on [[26 January]], 1950, India chose to be a republic, and a new [[Constitution of India|Constitution]] came into effect."
