The northern region of [[Kashmir]] is currently administered by India, Pakistan, and China (and coloured in as such). The delimiting of the three administered regions is ''not'' the international boundary but a ceasefire line demarcated in red. The boundary separating India and Pakistan is known as the [[Line of Control]], that separating India and China as the '[[Line of Actual Control]]'. Most of the state of [[Arunachal Pradesh]] is still claimed by China.</ref>]]\nFor most of its independent history, India has been ruled by the [[Indian National Congress]]. The party enjoyed a parliamentary majority barring two brief periods during the 1970s and late 1980s. This rule was interrupted between 1977 to 1980, when the [[Janata Party]] coalition won the election owing to public discontent with the [[Indian Emergency|\"Emergency\"]] declared by the then Prime Minister [[Indira Gandhi]]. The [[Janata Dal]] won elections in 1989, but its government managed to hold on to power for only two years. Between 1996 and 1998, there was a period of political flux with the government being formed first by the [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] nationalist [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] followed by a left-leaning [[United Front (India)|United Front]] coalition. In 1998, the BJP formed the [[National Democratic Alliance]] (NDA) with smaller regional parties, and became the first non-Congress and coalition government to complete a full five-year term. The [[Indian general elections, 2004|2004 Indian elections]] saw the Congress party winning the largest number of seats to form a government leading the [[United Progressive Alliance]], and supported by left-parties and those opposed to the BJP.\n\nSince independence, India has maintained cordial relationships with most nations. It took a lead in the 1950s in advocating the independence of European colonies in Africa and Asia. During the [[Cold War]], India tried to maintain its neutrality and was one of the founding members of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]]. After the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965]], India's relationship with the [[Soviet Union]] warmed at the expense of its ties with the [[United States]] and continued to remain so till the end of the Cold War. India has consistently refused to sign the [[CTBT]] and the [[NPT]] to maintain sovereignty over its nuclear program despite criticism and military sanctions from leading nations. Recent overtures by the Indian government have strengthened India's relations with United States, China and Pakistan. In the economic sphere, India has close relationships with other developing nations of [[South America]], [[Asia]] and [[Africa]], especially [[Brazil]] and [[Mexico]]. In recent years, India has played an influential role in the [[ASEAN]], [[SAARC]] and the [[WTO]], and it is a signatory to the landmark [[South Asia Free Trade Agreement]]. India has been a long time supporter of the [[United Nations]], with over 55,000 [[Indian Armed Forces|Indian military]] and police personnel having served in 35 UN peace keeping operations over four continents.<ref name=\"UN\">{{cite web | title = India and the United Nations | url = http://www.un.int/india/india_and_the_un_pkeeping.html | accessdate = April 22 | accessyear = 2006}}</ref>\n\n==Administrative Divisions==\n{{main|States and territories of India}}\n\nIndia is divided into twenty-eight states (which are further subdivided into [[districts of India|districts]]) and seven [[union territories]]. All states and the union territories of Delhi and Pondicherry have elected governments. The remaining five union territories have centrally-appointed administrators.\n\n{{India states}}\n\n==Geography==\n{{main|Geography of India}}\n[[Image:Yumthanghimalayas.jpg|thumb|270px|The [[Himalaya]]s stretch from [[Jammu and Kashmir]] in the north to [[Arunachal Pradesh]] in the far east making up most of India's eastern borders]]\nThe territory of India constitutes a major portion of the [[Indian subcontinent]], situated on the [[Indian Plate]], the northerly portion of the [[Indo-Australian Plate]], in [[southern Asia]]. India's northern and northeastern states are partially situated in the [[Himalaya|Himalayan Mountain Range]]. The rest of northern, central and eastern India consists of the fertile [[Indo-Gangetic plain]]. In the west, bordering southeast [[Pakistan]], lies the [[Thar Desert]]. The southern Indian Peninsula is almost entirely composed of the [[Deccan|Deccan plateau]], which is flanked by two hilly coastal ranges, the [[Western Ghats]] and [[Eastern Ghats]].\n\nIndia is home to several major rivers, including the [[Ganges|Ganga]], [[Brahmaputra]], [[Yamuna]], [[Godavari]], [[Kaveri]], [[Narmada]], and [[Krishna River|Krishna]]. India has three archipelagos &ndash; [[Lakshadweep]] off the southwest coast, the [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands]] volcanic island chain to the southeast, and the [[Sunderbans]] in the Gangetic delta in West Bengal. \n\nClimate in India varies from [[tropical climate|tropical]] in the south to more [[temperate climate|temperate]] in the north, with elevated regions in the north receiving sustained snowfall. India's climate is strongly influenced by the Himalayas and the Thar Desert. The Himalayas, along with the [[Hindu Kush]] mountains in Pakistan, provide a barrier to the cold winds from Central Asia. This keeps most of the Indian subcontinent warmer than most locations in similar latitudes. The Thar Desert is responsible for attracting the moisture laden [[southwest monsoon]] winds in that provide most of India's rainfall between June to September. \n\n{{see also|Climate of India|Ecoregions of India|Geology of India}}\n\n==Economy==\n{{main|Economy of India}}\n[[Image:Bombay-Stock-Exchange.jpg|thumb|180px|The [[Bombay Stock Exchange]] sensitive index is used as a determinant of the strength of the Indian economy.]]\n\nThe economy of India is the fourth-largest in the world as measured by [[purchasing power parity]] (PPP), with a [[Gross Domestic Product|GDP]] of US $3.36 [[trillion]]. When measured in [[United States dollar|USD]] [[exchange rate|exchange-rate]] terms, it is the tenth largest in the world, with a GDP of US $691.87 billion. India was the second fastest growing major economy in the world, with a GDP growth rate of 8.1% at the end of the first quarter of 2005&ndash;2006. However, India's huge population results in a relatively low [[per capita]] income of $3,400 at PPP and is classified as a [[developing nation]].{{inote|Source: CIA-Factbook: http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/in.html|CIA-2}}\n\nFor most of its independent history India has adhered to a socialist-inspired approach, with strict government control over [[private sector]] participation, [[foreign trade]], and [[foreign direct investment]]. Since the early 1990s, India has gradually opened up its markets through [[liberalization|economic reforms]] by reducing government controls on foreign trade and investment. [[Privatization|Privatisation]] of public-owned industries and opening up of certain sectors to private and foreign players has proceeded slowly amid political debate.\n\nIndia has a [[labour force]] of 496.4 million of which agriculture constitutes 60%, industry 17%, and services 23%. India's agricultural produce include rice, wheat, oilseed, cotton, jute, tea, sugarcane, potatoes; cattle, water buffalo, sheep, goats, poultry and fish. Major industries include textiles, chemicals, food processing, steel, transportation equipment, cement, mining, petroleum and machinery.<ref name=\"CIA\">{{cite web | title = CIA Factbook : India | work = CIA Factbook | url = http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/in.html | accessdate = April 15 | accessyear = 2006}}</ref>\n\nIn recent times, India has also capitalised on its large number of highly educated people who are fluent in the [[English language]] to become an important location for global companies [[outsourcing]] [[customer service]] and [[technical support]] [[call center]]s. It is also a major exporter of skilled workers in [[software]] services, [[financial]] services, and [[software engineering|software engineers]]. India's most important trading partners are the [[United States]], the [[European Union]], [[Japan]], the [[People's Republic of China]], and the [[United Arab Emirates]].{{inote|trade}}\n\n==Demographics==\n{{main|Demographics of India}}\n[[Image:Akshardhamindelhi.jpg|thumb|270px|The [[Akshardham]] [[Hinduism|Hindu]] temple, [[Delhi]]]]\nIndia is the second-most populous country in the world with an estimated 1.19 billion people in 2006.

Efforts to eradicate illiteracy have met with little success since India's independence with only 65.1% of its population (53.4% for females and 75.3% of males) being able to read or write. Rampant [[sex-selective abortion and infanticide]] exists in rural areas; the national [[sex ratio]] is 933 females per 1000 males.

An additional 21 languages are also given official status.{{inote|Source: Manorama Yearbook 2006|Manorama-3}}\n\n==Culture==\n{{main|Culture of India}}\n[[Image:Taj Mahal in March 2004.jpg|thumb|270px|right|The [[Taj Mahal]] in [[Agra]] is India's most popular tourist destination.]]\n[[Image:Kadakali_painting.jpg|thumb|155px|left|Face of a [[Kathakali]] artist, a type of [[Indian classical dance]], from [[Kerala]].]]\nIndia has a rich and unique cultural heritage, and has managed to preserve its established traditions throughout history whilst absorbing customs, traditions and ideas from both invaders and immigrants. Many cultural practices, languages, customs and monuments are examples of this co-mingling over centuries. Famous monuments, such as the [[Taj Mahal]] and other examples of Islamic-inspired architecture have been inherited from the Mughal dynasty. These are the result of a syncretic tradition that combined elements from all parts of the country. \n\n[[Music of India|Indian music]] is represented in a wide variety of forms. The two main forms of [[Indian classical music|classical music]] are ''[[Carnatic music|Carnatic]]'' from [[South India]], and ''[[Hindustani classical music|Hindustani]]'' from [[North India]]. Popular forms of music also prevail, the most notable being [[Filmi music]]. In addition to this are the diverse traditions of [[Indian folk music|folk music]] from different parts of the country. Many [[Indian classical dance|classical dance forms]] exist, including the [[Bharatanatyam]], [[Kathakali]], [[Kathak]] and [[Manipuri]]. They often have a narrative form and are usually infused with devotional and spiritual elements. The earliest [[Indian literature|literary traditions]] in India were mostly oral, and were later transcribed. Most of these are represented by sacred works like the [[Vedas]] and the epics of the [[Mahabharata]] and [[Ramayana]]. [[Sangam]] literature from Tamil Nadu represents some of India's oldest traditions. There have been many notable modern Indian writers, both in Indian languages and [[Indian Writing in English|in English]]. India's only [[Nobel Prize for Literature|Nobel laureate in literature]] was the [[Bengali language|Bengali]] writer [[Rabindranath Tagore]]. India produces the world's largest number of [[Cinema of India|films]] every year. The most recognisable face is that of cinema production based in Mumbai, which produces mainly commercial Hindi films, often referred to as \"[[Bollywood]]\". There are also strong cinema industries based on the [[Kannada language|Kannada]], [[Malayalam]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Telugu language|Telugu]] and [[Bengali cinema|Bengali]] languages.\nReligious practices of various faiths are an integral part of everyday life in society. Education is highly regarded by members of every socio-economic stratum. Traditional Indian family values are highly respected, and considered sacred, although urban families have grown to prefer a [[nuclear family]] system, owing to the socio-economic constraints imposed by the traditional [[complex family|joint family]] system. Religion in India is a very public affair, with many practices imbued with pomp and vitality accompanying their underlying spiritual qualities. \n\nThe [[cuisine of India]] is extremely diverse, as ingredients, spices and cooking methods vary from region to region. Rice and wheat are the staple foods in the country. The country is notable for its wide variety of [[vegetarian]] and non-vegetarian [[wikibooks:Cookbook:Cuisine of India|cuisine]]. Spicy food and sweets are popular in India. [[Indian Dress|Traditional dress]] in India greatly varies across the regions in its colours and styles, and depend on various factors, including climate. Popular styles of dress include the traditional [[sari]] for women and the traditional [[dhoti]] for men.\n\nIndia's national sport is [[field hockey]], although [[cricket]] is now the ''de facto'' national game. In some states, particularly in the northeast, [[football (soccer)]] is the most popular sport and is widely watched. In recent times, [[tennis]] has gained popularity in India with the rise of players such as [[Leander Paes]] and [[Sania Mirza]]. India is also represented in [[chess]], with international-level players such as [[Vishwanathan Anand]]. Traditional indigenous sports include [[kabaddi]]{{inote|http://www.rediff.com/sports/2000/aug/30india.htm|Rediff-1}} and [[gilli-danda]], which are played in most parts of the country.\n\n==Holidays==\n[[Image:DSCF9016.JPG|thumb|150px|[[Holi]], the festival of colours has emerged as one of the most popular Indian festivals.]]\n{{main|List of Festivals in India}}\n\nIndia is also known as a land of festivals. A melting pot of many religions, India has a rich diversity of [[Indian festivals|festivals]], many of which are celebrated irrespective of caste and creed. The most widely known and popular celebrations include the Hindu festivals of [[Diwali]], [[Holi]], [[Pongal]] and [[Dussehra]] and the Muslim celebration of [[Eid]].\n\nA number of festivals are common to most parts of India; however, they may be called by different names in the various parts of the country or may be celebrated in a different fashion. Every festival is celebrated in a unique style.\n\nIndia has four National Holidays. Other sets of holidays, varying between nine to twelve, pertains to festivals, religious holidays and births of leaders which are legislated by the individual states.\n<div style=\"clear:both\" />\n<center>\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"3\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"90%\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse; border:1px solid #aaa; text-align:left\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#efefef;\" width=\"15%\" | Date\n! style=\"background:#efefef;\" width=\"20%\" | Holiday\n! style=\"background:#efefef;\" | Remarks\n|-\n| [[26 January]]\n| [[Republic Day of India|Republic Day]]\n| The Constitution of India came into effect on this day in 1950.\n|-\n| [[1 May]]\n| [[May Day]]\n| Labor Day [[May Day]].\n|-\n| [[15 August]]\n| [[Indian Independence Day|Independence Day]]\n| India gained its independence from the British Empire on this day in 1947.\n|-\n| [[2 October]]\n| [[Gandhi Jayanti]]\n| The Birth Date of [[Mahatma Gandhi]].\n|}\n\n</center>\n\n==See also==\n{{Topics related to India}}\n{{India ties}}\n{{Life in India}}\n\n==External links==\n{{portal}}\n{{sisterlinks|India}}\n<!--PLEASE ADD SITES RELATING TO INDIA AS A WHOLE.
