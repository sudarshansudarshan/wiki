In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of [[Sri Lanka]] and the [[Maldives]]; in addition, India's [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands]] share a maritime border with [[Thailand]] and [[Indonesia]].\n\nHome to the ancient [[Indus Valley Civilisation]] and a region of historic trade routes and vast empires, the [[Indian subcontinent]] was identified with its commercial and cultural wealth for much of its long history.{{Sfn|Stein|2008|pp=16\u201317}} Four of the world's major religions\u2014[[Hinduism in India|Hinduism]], [[History of Buddhism in India|Buddhism]], [[Statistics of Jainism|Jainism]], and [[Sikhism in India|Sikhism]]\u2014originated here, whereas [[Parsi|Zoroastrianism]], [[Christianity in India|Christianity]], and [[Islam in India|Islam]] arrived in the 1st millennium CE and also helped shape the region's [[Indian culture|diverse culture]]. Gradually annexed by and brought under the administration of the [[Company rule in India|British East India Company]] from the early 18th century and [[British Raj|administered directly]] by the United Kingdom from the mid-19th century, India became an independent nation in 1947 after a [[Indian independence movement|struggle for independence]] that was marked by [[non-violent resistance]] and led by [[Mahatma Gandhi]].\n\nThe [[Economy of India|Indian economy]] is the world's tenth-largest by [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|nominal GDP]] and third-largest by [[List of countries by GDP (PPP)|purchasing power parity]] (PPP). Following [[Economic liberalisation in India|market-based economic reforms]] in 1991, India became one of the [[List of countries by GDP (real) growth rate|fastest-growing major economies]]; it is considered a [[newly industrialized country|newly industrialised country]]. However, it continues to face the challenges of [[poverty in India|poverty]], [[Literacy in India|illiteracy]], [[Corruption in India|corruption]], and [[Healthcare in India|inadequate public healthcare]]. A [[nuclear weapons state]] and a [[regional power]], it has the [[List of countries by number of troops|third-largest standing army]] in the world and ranks [[List of countries by military expenditures|tenth in military expenditure]] among nations. India is a [[Federalism|federal]] [[constitutional republic]] governed under a [[parliamentary system]] consisting of [[States and territories of India|28 states and 7 union territories]]. It is one of the five [[BRICS]] nations. India is a pluralistic, [[Languages of India|multilingual]], and [[Culture of India|multiethnic society]]. It is also home to a diversity of [[Wildlife of India|wildlife]] in a variety of [[Protected areas of India|protected habitats]].\n\n==Etymology==\n{{Main|Names of India}}\n\nThe name ''India'' is derived from ''[[Indus River|Indus]]'', which is derived from the [[Old Persian language|Old Persian]] word ''[[Hindu]]'', from [[Sanskrit]] ''Sindhu'' (\u0938\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0927\u0941), the historic local appellation for the Indus River.{{Sfn|Oxford English Dictionary}} The [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] referred to the Indians as ''Indoi'' (\u0399\u03bd\u03b4\u03bf\u03af), the people of the Indus.{{Sfn|Kuiper|2010|p=86}} The [[Constitution of India]] and usage in [[Names of the Republic of India in its official languages|many Indian languages]] also recognises ''Bharat'' (pronounced {{IPA-hns|\u02c8b\u02b1a\u02d0r\u0259t\u032a||hi-Bharat.ogg}}) as an official name of equal status.{{Sfn|Ministry of Law and Justice 2008}} The name Bharat is derived from the name of the legendary king [[Bharata (emperor)|Bharata]] in Hindu scriptures. ''[[Hindustan]]'' ({{IPA-hns|\u0266\u026and\u032a\u028a\u02c8st\u032aa\u02d0n||Hindustan.ogg}}), originally a [[Persian language|Persian]] word for \"Land of the Hindus\" and referring to North India and Pakistan before 1947, is also occasionally used as a synonym for all of India.{{Sfn|Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica}}\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of India|History of the Republic of India}}\n\n===Ancient India===\n\nThe earliest [[anatomically modern human]] remains found in South Asia are from approximately 30,000 years ago.{{Sfn|Singh|2009|p=64}} Nearly contemporaneous [[Mesolithic]] rock art sites have been found in many parts of the Indian subcontinent, including at the [[Bhimbetka rock shelters]] in [[Madhya Pradesh]].{{Sfn|Singh|2009|pp=89&ndash;93}} Around 7000 BCE, the first known [[neolithic]] settlements appeared on the subcontinent in [[Mehrgarh]] and other sites in western Pakistan.{{Sfn|Possehl|2003|pp=24\u201325}} These gradually developed into the [[Indus Valley Civilisation]],{{Sfn|Kulke|Rothermund|2004|pp=21\u201323}} the first urban culture in South Asia,{{Sfn|Singh|2009|p=181}} which flourished during 2500\u20131900&nbsp;BCE in Pakistan and western India.{{Sfn|Possehl|2003|p=2}} Centred around cities such as [[Mohenjo-daro]], [[Harappa]], [[Dholavira]], and [[Kalibangan]], and relying on varied forms of subsistence, the civilisation engaged robustly in crafts production and wide-ranging trade.{{Sfn|Singh|2009|p=181}}\n\n[[File:Indischer Maler des 6. Jahrhunderts 001.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Damaged brown painting of a reclining man and woman.|Paintings at the [[Ajanta Caves]] in [[Aurangabad, Maharashtra|Aurangabad]], [[Maharashtra]], 6th century.]]\n\nDuring the period 2000\u2013500 BCE, many regions of the subcontinent evolved from [[copper age]] to [[iron age]] cultures.{{Sfn|Singh|2009|p=255}} The [[Vedas]], the oldest scriptures of Hinduism,{{Sfn|Singh|2009|pp=186\u2013187}} were composed during this period, and historians have analyzed these to posit a [[Vedic culture]] in the [[Punjab region]] and the upper [[Ganges Plain]].{{Sfn|Singh|2009|p=255}} Most historians also consider this period to have encompassed several waves of [[Indo-Aryan migration]] into the subcontinent from the north-west.{{Sfn|Singh|2009|pp=186\u2013187}} The [[caste system]], which created a hierarchy of priests, warriors, and free peasants, but which excluded indigenous peoples by labeling their occupations impure, arose during this period.{{Sfn|Kulke|Rothermund|2004|pp=41\u201343}} In the [[Deccan]], archaeological evidence from this period suggests the existence of a [[chiefdom]] stage of political organisation.{{Sfn|Singh|2009|p=255}} In [[South India]], the large number of [[megalithic]] monuments found from this period,{{Sfn|Singh|2009|pp=250\u2013251}} and nearby evidence of agriculture, [[irrigation tank]]s, and craft traditions suggest progression to sedentary life.{{Sfn|Singh|2009|pp=250\u2013251}}\n\nBy the 5th century BCE, the small chiefdoms of the Ganges Plain and the north-west regions had consolidated into 16 major [[oligarchies]] and monarchies called ''[[Mahajanapadas]]''.{{Sfn|Singh|2009|p=319}}{{Sfn|Kulke|Rothermund|2004|pp=53\u201354}} The emerging urbanisation as well as the orthodoxies of the late Vedic age created the religious reform movements of [[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]].{{Sfn|Kulke|Rothermund|2004|pp=54\u201356}} Buddhism, based on the teachings of India's first historical figure, [[Gautam Buddha]], attracted followers from all social classes excepting the middle;{{Sfn|Kulke|Rothermund|2004|pp=54\u201356}}{{Sfn|Stein|2008|pp=67\u201368}} Jainism came into prominence around the same time during the life of its exemplar, [[Mahavira]].{{Sfn|Singh|2009|pp=312\u2013313}} In an age of increasing urban wealth, both religions held up [[Nekkhamma|renunciation]] as an ideal,{{Sfn|Singh|2009|p=300}} and both established long-lasting monasteries.{{Sfn|Singh|2009|p=319}} Politically, by the 3rd century BCE, the kingdom of [[Magadha]] had annexed or reduced other states to emerge as the [[Mauryan Empire]].{{Sfn|Singh|2009|p=319}} The empire was once thought to have controlled most of the subcontinent excepting the far south, but its core regions are now thought to have been separated by large autonomous areas.{{Sfn|Stein|2008|pp=78\u201379}}{{Sfn|Kulke|Rothermund|2004|p=70}} The Maurya kings are known as much for their empire building and determined management of public life as for [[Ashoka the Great]]'s renunciation of militarism and far-flung advocacy of the Buddhist ''[[dhamma]]''.{{Sfn|Singh|2009|p=367}}{{Sfn|Kulke|Rothermund|2004|p=63}}\n\nThe [[Sangam literature]] of the [[Tamil language]] reveals that, between 200 BCE and 200 CE, the southern peninsula was being ruled by the [[Chera Dynasty|Cheras]], the [[Cholas]], and the [[Pandyas]], dynasties that traded extensively with the [[Roman Empire]] and with [[West Asia|West]] and [[South-East Asia]].{{Sfn|Stein|2008|pp=89\u201390}}{{Sfn|Singh|2009|pp=408\u2013415}} In North India, Hinduism asserted [[Patriarchy|patriarchal]] control within the family leading to increased subordination of women.{{Sfn|Stein|2008|pp=92\u201395}}{{Sfn|Singh|2009|p=319}} By the 4th and 5th centuries, the [[Gupta Empire]] had created a complex administrative and taxation system in the greater Ganges Plain that became a model for later Indian kingdoms.{{Sfn|Kulke|Rothermund|2004|pp=89\u201391}}{{Sfn|Singh|2009|p=545}} Under the Guptas, a renewed Hinduism based on devotion rather than the management of ritual began to assert itself.{{Sfn|Stein|2008|pp=98\u201399}} The renewal was reflected in a flowering of [[Indian sculpture|sculpture]] and [[Indian architecture|architecture]], which found patrons among an urban elite.{{Sfn|Singh|2009|p=545}} [[Sanskrit literature#Classical Sanskrit literature|Classical Sanskrit literature]] flowered as well, and [[History of Indian science and technology|Indian science]], [[Indian astronomy|astronomy]], [[Ayurveda|medicine]], and [[Indian mathematics|mathematics]] made significant advances.{{Sfn|Singh|2009|p=545}}\n\n===Medieval India===\n[[File:Big Temple-Temple.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The granite [[gopuram|tower]] of [[Brihadeeswarar Temple]] in [[Thanjavur]] was completed in 1010 CE by [[Raja Raja Chola I]].]]\n\nThe Indian early medieval age, 600 CE to 1200 CE, is defined by regional kingdoms and cultural diversity.{{Sfn|Stein|2008|p=132}} When [[Harsha]] of [[Kannauj]], who ruled much of the Ganges plain from 606 to 647 CE, attempted to expand southwards, he was defeated by the [[Chalukya dynasty|Chalukya]] ruler of the [[Deccan]].{{Sfn|Stein|2008|pp=119\u2013120}} When his successor attempted to expand eastwards, he was defeated by the [[Pala Empire|Pala]] king of [[Bengal]].{{Sfn|Stein|2008|pp=119\u2013120}} When the Chalukyas attempted to expand southwards, they were defeated by the [[Pallava]]s from farther south, who in turn were opposed by the [[Pandyan Dynasty|Pandya]]s and the [[Chola dynasty|Chola]]s from still farther south.{{Sfn|Stein|2008|pp=119\u2013120}} No ruler of this period was able to create an empire and consistently control lands much beyond his core region.{{Sfn|Stein|2008|p=132}} During this time, pastoral peoples whose land had been cleared to make way for the growing agriculture economy were accommodated within caste society, as were new non-traditional ruling classes.{{Sfn|Stein|2008|pp=121\u2013122}} The caste system consequently began to show regional differences.{{Sfn|Stein|2008|pp=121\u2013122}}\n\nIn the 6th and 7th centuries, the first [[Bhakti|devotional hymns]] were created in the [[Tamil language]].{{Sfn|Stein|2008|p=123}} They were imitated all over India and led to both the resurgence of Hinduism and the development of all [[Languages of India|modern languages of the subcontinent]].{{Sfn|Stein|2008|p=123}} Indian royalty, [[Maharaja|big]] and [[Samanta|small]], and the temples they patronised, drew citizens in great numbers to the capital cities, which became economic hubs as well.{{Sfn|Stein|2008|p=124}} Temple towns of various sizes began to appear everywhere as India underwent another urbanisation.{{Sfn|Stein|2008|p=124}} By the 8th and 9th centuries, the effects were felt in South-East Asia, as South Indian culture and political systems were exported to what today are [[Thailand]], [[Laos]], [[Cambodia]], [[Vietnam]], [[Malaysia]], and [[Java]].{{Sfn|Stein|2008|pp=127\u2013128}} Indian merchants, scholars, and sometimes armies were involved in this transmission; South-East Asians took the initiative as well with many sojourning in Indian seminaries and translating Buddhist and Hindu texts into their languages.{{Sfn|Stein|2008|pp=127\u2013128}} \n\nAfter the 10th century, Muslim Central Asian nomadic clans, using [[courser (horse)|swift-horse]] cavalry and raising vast armies united by
