Jahrhunderts 001.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Damaged brown painting of a reclining man and woman.|Paintings at the [[Ajanta Caves]] in [[Aurangabad, Maharashtra|Aurangabad]], [[Maharashtra]], sixth century.]]\n\nDuring the period 2000&ndash;500 BCE, many regions of the subcontinent evolved from [[copper age]] to [[iron age]] cultures.{{Sfn|Singh|2009|p=255}} The [[Vedas]], the oldest scriptures of [[Hinduism]],{{Sfn|Singh|2009|pp=186&ndash;187}} were composed during this period, and historians have analyzed these to posit a [[Vedic culture]] in the [[Punjab region]] and the upper [[Ganges Plain]].{{Sfn|Singh|2009|p=255}} Most historians also consider this period to have encompassed several waves of [[Indo-Aryan migration]] into the subcontinent from the northwest.{{Sfn|Singh|2009|pp=186&ndash;187}} The [[caste system]], which spawned a social hierarchy, appeared during this period.{{Sfn|Kulke|Rothermund|2004|pp=41&ndash;43}} In the [[Deccan]], archaeological evidence from this period suggests the existence of a [[chiefdom]] stage of political organization.{{Sfn|Singh|2009|p=255}} In [[South India]], the large number of [[megalithic]] monuments found from this period,{{Sfn|Singh|2009|pp=250&ndash;251}} and nearby evidence of agriculture, [[irrigation tank]]s, and craft traditions suggest progression to sedentary life.{{Sfn|Singh|2009|pp=250&ndash;251}}\n\nBy the fifth century BCE, the small chiefdoms of the Ganges Plain and the northwest regions had consolidated into 16 major [[oligarchies]] and monarchies called ''[[Mahajanapadas]]''.{{Sfn|Singh|2009|p=319}}{{Sfn|Kulke|Rothermund|2004|pp=53&ndash;54}} The emerging urbanization as well as the orthodoxies of the late Vedic age created the religious reform movements of [[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]].{{Sfn|Kulke|Rothermund|2004|pp=54&ndash;56}} Buddhism, based on the teachings of India's first historical figure, [[Gautam Buddha]], attracted followers from all social classes;{{Sfn|Kulke|Rothermund|2004|pp=54&ndash;56}}{{Sfn|Stein|2008|pp=67&ndash;68}} Jainism came into prominence around the same time during the life of its exemplar, [[Mahavira]].{{Sfn|Singh|2009|pp=312&ndash;313}} In an age of increasing urban wealth, both religions held up [[Nekkhamma|renunciation]] as an ideal,{{Sfn|Singh|2009|p=300}} and both established long-lasting monasteries.{{Sfn|Singh|2009|p=319}} Politically, by the 3rd century BCE, the kingdom of [[Magadha]] had annexed or reduced other states to emerge as the [[Mauryan Empire]].{{Sfn|Singh|2009|p=319}} The empire was once thought to have controlled most of the subcontinent excepting the far south, but its core regions are now thought to have been separated by large autonomous areas.{{Sfn|Stein|2008|pp=78&ndash;79}}{{Sfn|Kulke|Rothermund|2004|p=70}} The Maurya kings are known as much for their empire building and determined management of public life as for [[Ashoka the Great]], who renounced militarism and widely advocated the Buddhist ''[[dhamma]]''.{{Sfn|Singh|2009|p=367}}{{Sfn|Kulke|Rothermund|2004|p=63}}\n\nThe [[Sangam literature]] of the [[Tamil language]] reveals that during the period from 200 BCE to 200 CE, the southern peninsula was being ruled by the [[Chera Dynasty|Cheras]], the [[Cholas]], and the [[Pandyas]], dynasties that traded extensively with the [[Roman Empire]] and with [[West Asia|west]] and [[south-east Asia]].{{Sfn|Stein|2008|pp=89&ndash;90}}{{Sfn|Singh|2009|pp=408&ndash;415}}\nIn north India during the same time, Hinduism asserted [[Patriarchy|patriarchal]] control within the family.{{Sfn|Stein|2008|pp=92&ndash;95}}{{Sfn|Singh|2009|p=319}} By the fourth and fifth centuries CE, the [[Gupta Empire]] had created a complex administrative and taxation system in the greater Ganges Plain that became a model for later Indian kingdoms.{{Sfn|Kulke|Rothermund|2004|pp=89&ndash;91}}{{Sfn|Singh|2009|p=545}} Under the Guptas, a renewed Hinduism based on devotion rather than the management of ritual began to assert itself;{{Sfn|Stein|2008|pp=98&ndash;99}} this was reflected in a flowering of [[Indian sculpture|sculpture]] and [[Indian architecture|architecture]], which found patrons among an urban elite.{{Sfn|Singh|2009|p=545}} [[Sanskrit literature#Classical Sanskrit literature|Classical Sanskrit literature]] flowered as well, and [[History of Indian science and technology|Indian science]], [[Indian astronomy|astronomy]], [[Ayurveda|medicine]], and [[Indian mathematics|mathematics]] made significant advances.{{Sfn|Singh|2009|p=545}}\n\n===Medieval India===\n[[File:Big Temple-Temple.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The [[Brihadeeswarar Temple]] in [[Thanjavur]], in the state of [[Tamil Nadu]], was built by the [[Chola]]s in 1010 CE.]]\n\nThe Indian [[early medieval]] age (600 CE to 1200 CE) is defined by regional kingdoms and cultural diversity.{{Sfn|Stein|2008|p=132}} When [[Harsha]] of [[Kannauj]], who ruled much of the Ganges plain from 606 to 647 CE, attempted to expand southwards, he was defeated by the [[Chalukya dynasty|Chalukya]] ruler of the [[Deccan]].{{Sfn|Stein|2008|pp=119&ndash;120}} When his successor attempted to expand eastwards, he was defeated by the [[Pala Empire|Pala]] king of [[Bengal]].{{Sfn|Stein|2008|pp=119&ndash;120}} When the Chalukyas attempted to expand southwards, they were defeated by the [[Pallava]]s from farther south, who in turn were opposed by the [[Pandyan Dynasty|Pandya]]s and the [[Chola dynasty|Chola]]s from still farther south.{{Sfn|Stein|2008|pp=119&ndash;120}} No ruler of this period was able to create an empire and consistently control lands much beyond his core region.{{Sfn|Stein|2008|p=132}} During this time, pastoral peoples whose land had been cleared to make way for the growing agricultural economy were accommodated within caste society, as were new non-traditional ruling classes.{{Sfn|Stein|2008|pp=121&ndash;122}} The caste system consequently began to show regional differences.{{Sfn|Stein|2008|pp=121&ndash;122}}\n\nIn the sixth and seventh centuries CE, the first [[Bhakti|devotional hymns]] were created in the [[Tamil language]].{{Sfn|Stein|2008|p=123}} These were imitated all over India and led both to the resurgence of Hinduism and to the development of all the [[Languages of India|modern languages]] of the subcontinent.{{Sfn|Stein|2008|p=123}} Indian royalty, [[Maharaja|big]] and [[Samanta|small]], and the temples they patronised, drew citizens in great numbers to the capital cities, which became economic hubs as well.{{Sfn|Stein|2008|p=124}} Temple towns of various sizes began to appear everywhere as India underwent another urbanisation.{{Sfn|Stein|2008|p=124}} By the eight and ninth centuries, the effects were evident in South Indian culture and elsewhere, as political systems were exported to Southeast Asia, in
