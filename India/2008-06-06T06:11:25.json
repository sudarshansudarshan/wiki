Ajrawat]</ref>. The idea is highly [[controversial]] among Sikhs, Sikhs in India generally do agree with the idea of Khalistan as do most NRI's. Moreover, most major Sikh leaders, in the modern era, believed that like Muslims in [[Pakistan]], [[Sikhs]] too should separate from [[India]]. Most neutral political commentators believe the violence against non-Sikhs and followed by the [[Operation Blue Star|removal of gunmen]] from the [[Golden Temple]] was the next catalyst  behind the [[separatist]] movement. The [[separatist]] [[Khalistan movement|movement for Khalistan]] rose to its crest in 1980s in India and then slowly ebbed out, however the movement now finds widespread support among expatriate Sikhs<ref\nPolitical [[lobbyists]] in the USA once included politicians [[Dan Burton]]<ref>http://www.khalistan.com/PressReleases/PR051204_DrAulakhTestifies.htm Dr. Aulakh, Others Expose Indian Human Rights Violations at Congressional Hearing</ref>, [[Jesse Helms]]<ref>Studying the Sikhs: Issues for North America By John Stratton Hawley, Gurinder Singh Mann, Published 1993\nSUNY Press</ref>, and [[Edolphus Towns]]<ref>http://bulk.resource.org/gpo.gov/record/1998/1998_E02197.pdf DR.

It then slowly ebbed out, primarily due to the loss of popular support. The movement also hindered economic investment, became increasingly militant, and threw Punjab into a state of [[anarchy]] with increased levels of [[terrorism]]. The movement was also countered by counter-terrorism operations conducted by the [[Indian Army]] and the [[Punjab Police]] led by [[KPS Gill]] which caused the deaths of thousands of innocent Sikhs according to the [[Human Rights Watch]]. \n\nAfter the bombing of [[Air India Flight 182]] that claimed the lives of 329 Canadian civilians over the Irish Sea, the worst aviation terrorist attack before [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], support for Khalistan lessened to a large extent. Two of the accused in the case, the Sikh separatists [[Ripudaman Singh Malik]] and [[Ajaib Singh Bagri]] were found not guilty for lack of admissible evidence and released, while a third accused [[Inderjit Singh Reyat]] was sentenced to ten years after pleading guilty.<ref>[http://archives.cbc.ca/IDC-1-70-1018-5695/disasters_tragedies/air_india_investigation/clip6 Sentencing Inderjit Singh Reyat]</ref> In [[1989]] Canadian journalists Zuhair Kashmeri and Brian McAndrew in their book ''[[Soft Target (book)| Soft Target]]'' propounded a [[conspiracy theory]] that the Government of India could have staged the attack to portray the separatists in bad light.

In 1999, [[Canadian Journalists for Free Expression]] renamed its Press Freedom Award the \"Tara Singh Hayer Press Freedom Award\" in Hayer's honour. Each year, the award is given to a Canadian journalist who, through his or her work, has made an important contribution to reinforcing and promoting the principle of freedom of the press in Canada or elsewhere.\n\n==Geography==\n\nAccording to the Khalistan web-site: \n\n<blockquote>The geographical boundaries of Khalistan will include current East Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pardesh, part of Rajasthan and small part of Uttar Pardesh. River Ravi on the west and river Jamuna on the east will be some of the boundary lines between Khalistan & Pakistan, Khalistan & India respectively. In the north, part of Himalayan range and in south, part of Thar Desert will make the geographical boundaries of Khalistan. <ref>http://www.khalistan.net</ref></blockquote>\n\nThis would still end up making the proposed region a [[Hindu]] majority by default.<ref>A Demographic Case Study of Forced Migration:The 1947 Partition of India Authors: Hill K, Seltzer W, Leaning J , Malik SJ, Russell SS4, Makinson C,  http://paa2004.princeton.edu/download.asp?submissionId=41274</ref> Paramjit Singh Ajrawat states that Khalistan will be a [[theocratic]] state with a non-[[secular]] based fundamentalist constitution.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n* [http://www.punjabtrauma.org/ List of terrorist violence in Punjab]\n* [http://security.homeoffice.gov.uk/legislation/current-legislation/terrorism-act-2000/proscribed-terrorist-groups List of terrorist groups banned across Europe]\n* [http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/41056.pdf List of terrorist groups banned by US Government]\n* [http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGASA200022003?open&of=ENG-IND Amnesty International on Punjab lack of Justice and Impunity]\n* [http://www.flight182.com/ Death of Flight 182 website]\n* [http://hrw.org/english/docs/2007/10/18/india17103.htm Human Rights Watch; Time for India to Deliver Justice in Punjab]\n\n[[Category:Khalistan movement]]\n[[Category:UNPO]]\n[[Category:Wikipedia controversial topics]]\n\n[[de:Khalistan]]\n[[fr:Khalistan]]\n[[lt:Chalistanas]]\n[[nl:Khalistan]]\n[[pa:\u0a16\u0a3e\u0a32\u0a3f\u0a38\u0a24\u0a3e\u0a28]]\n[[ru:\u0425\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d]]\n[[simple:Khalistan]]\n[[th:\u0e02\u0e32\u0e25\u0e34\u0e2a\u0e16\u0e32\u0e19]]\n[[ur:\u062e\u0627\u0644\u0635\u062a\u0627\u0646]]"
