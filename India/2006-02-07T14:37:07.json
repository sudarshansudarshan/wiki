It has a coastline of over seven thousand kilometres,{{inote|see Indian embassy|i-1}} borders [[Pakistan]] to the west, the [[People's Republic of China]], [[Nepal]], and [[Bhutan]] to the northeast, and [[Bangladesh]] and [[Myanmar]] to the east. On the [[Indian Ocean]], it is adjacent to three [[island nation]]s \u2014 the [[Maldives]] to the southwest, [[Sri Lanka]] to the south, and [[Indonesia]] to the southeast. India also claims a border with [[Afghanistan]] to the northwest.{{mn|afgh|1}}\n\nThe name ''India'' {{IPA2|'\u026andi\u0259}} is derived from the [[Old Persian]] version of ''[[Sindhu]]'', the historic local name for the [[Indus river]] (see [[Origin of India's name]]). The [[Constitution of India]], and common usage also recognises '''Bharat''' ({{lang-hi|\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924}} {{IPA2|b<sup>\u0266</sup>a\u02d0r\u0259t\u032a}} {{Audio|Bharat.ogg|listen}}) as an official name of equal status. This name is derived from the [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]] name of an ancient [[Hindu]] king whose story can be found in the [[Mahabharata]] [[epic poem]]. A third name, '''[[Hindustan]]''' ({{lang-hi|\u0939\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0926\u0941\u0938\u094d\u0924\u093e\u0928}} <!-- THIS SPELLING IS CORRECT.

It is the [[List of countries by population|second most populous]] country, with a [[population]] of over [[1 E9|one billion]], and the [[List of countries by area|seventh largest]] by geographical [[area]]. It is home to the [[Indus Valley Civilisation]] \u2014 one of the most ancient civilizations in recorded history \u2014 and a centre of important historic [[trade route]]s. Four [[major world religions]] \u2014 [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Jainism]] and [[Sikhism]] \u2014 have Indian origins. India was a part of the [[British Empire]] before gaining [[Indian independence movement|independence]] in 1947. In the last twenty years, it has grown significantly, especially in the [[Economy of India|economic]] and [[Military of India|military]] spheres.\n\nThis Country is POOR\n\n\n\nThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POORThis Country is VERY POOR\n\n\n\n==Sports and games==\n{{main|Sports in India}}\n\nIndia's national sport is [[field hockey]], although [[cricket]] is now the ''de facto'' national game due to its success and popularity in recent times. But cricket is not the most popular sport in quite a few states, particularly in the northeast. [[Chess]] is another international sport in which India is quite strong: [[Viswanathan Anand]] was [[FIDE]] World Champion, and several players have made significant inroads in recent years, well past the [[International Grandmaster|Grandmaster]] level. India also has a tradition of cue sports ([[snooker]], [[billiards]], etc) and shooting.\n\nIndia has had relatively little success in other international events like the [[Olympics]], where it garnered just one silver medal and two bronze medals in the previous three outings. However, it had won eight [[field hockey]] golds until 1980. India has done rather well in [[Davis Cup]] [[tennis]] tournaments, reaching the finals on three occasions. Its players have secured several individual titles and [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] doubles wins, but an Indian is yet to win a Grand Slam singles.\n\nTraditional indigenous sports include [[polo]], [[kabaddi]], [[Kho Kho]] and [[gilli-danda]], which are played in most parts of the country. Chess, [[badminton]] and [[carrom]] are also said to have originated in India. Snooker and badminton have seen Indians achieve some international success. [[Football (soccer)]] is also widely watched in almost the entire country, and is the most popular sport in many states. [[Formula 1]] racing is also increasing in popularity, due to racing driver [[Narain Karthikeyan]], though its reach is largely limited to urban areas.\n\n==See also==\n{{Topics related to
