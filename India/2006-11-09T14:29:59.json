The [[Constitution of India]] and common usage recognise '''Bharat Ganrajya''' ({{IPAudio|Bharat.ogg|/b\u02b1a\u02d0r\u0259t\u032a/ }}), as an official name; The Republic of India is also recognized with equal status. A second name, ''[[Hindustan]]''{{inote|THIS SPELLING IS CORRECT. PLEASE READ [[Wikipedia:text support for Indic scripts]]|Indic support}} ({{IPAudio|Hindustan.ogg|/\u0266\u026an\u032ad\u032a\u028ast\u032aa\u02d0n/ }}) ([[Persian language|Persian]]: ''[[stan|Land]] of the Hindus'') {{inote|ref:Webster's New World Dictionary|Indus}} has been used since the twelfth century, although its contemporary use is unevenly applied.  \"Bharat\" is derived from King Bharat, who is said to have ruled over the landmass known as Bharatavarsha, the Sanskrit name for India.    Hindustan is the name given by Persians to those who lived in the land east of the river Indus (Sindhu), or Hind in short.  In general, the three names \"Bharata,\" \"Hindustan,\" and \"India\" are used interchangeably, although sometimes \"Hindustan\" is used to refer only to North India.\n\n==History==\n<!-- THIS SECTION IS A SUMMARY. CONSIDER ADDING MATERIAL TO THE 'HISTORY OF INDIA' ARTICLE.-->\n{{main|History of India}}\n[[Stone Age]] rock shelters with paintings at [[Bhimbetka]] in the state of [[Madhya Pradesh]] are the earliest known traces of human life in India. The first known permanent settlements appeared over 9,000 years ago and gradually developed into the [[Indus Valley Civilization]], dating back to 3300 BCE in western India. It was followed by the [[Vedic Civilization]] which laid the foundations of [[Hinduism]] and other cultural aspects of early Indian society. From around 550 BCE, many independent kingdoms and republics known as the [[Mahajanapadas]] were established across the country laying the foundations of ancient India.\n\nThe [[Maurya Empire|empire]] built by the [[Maurya dynasty]] under Emperor [[Ashoka|Ashoka the Great]] united most of modern [[South Asia|Southern Asia]] except the [[Dravidian people|Dravidian]] kingdoms in the south and laid the first foundation of a united subcontinental territory. From 180 BCE, a series of invasions from [[Central Asia]] into the north-western [[Indian Subcontinent]] followed, including the [[Indo-Greek]]s, [[Indo-Scythian]]s, [[Indo-Parthian]]s and the [[Kushan Empire|Kushans]]. From the third century CE, the [[Gupta Empire|Gupta dynasty]] oversaw the period referred to as ancient India's \"Golden Age.\" While the north had larger, fewer kingdoms, in the south there were several dynasties such as the [[Chalukyas]], [[Rashtrakutas]], [[Hoysalas]], [[Cheras]], [[Cholas]], [[Pallavas]] and [[Pandyas]] in different times and regions. The political influence of these mighty southern kingdoms, though felt to a lesser extent by north India, extended into [[Southeast Asia]] and [[Sri Lanka]] and deeply influenced their culture. The southern kingdoms remained relatively more stable and carried out maritime trade in spices and precious gems with the Arabia, China and Europe from ancient times. [[Ancient Indian science and technology|Science, engineering]], [[Indian art|art]], [[Indian literature|literature]], [[Indian Mathematics|mathematics]], [[Indian science|astronomy]], [[Religion in India|religion]] and [[Indian philosophy|philosophy]] flourished under the patronage of these kings.\n[[Image:Sanchi2.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The [[Sanchi|Sanchi stupa]] in Sanchi, [[Madhya Pradesh]] built by emperor Ashoka in the 3rd century BC]]\n\nFollowing the invasions from Central Asia, between the tenth to the twelfth centuries, much of north India came under the rule of the [[Delhi Sultanate]], and later the [[Mughal dynasty]], who gradually expanded their reign through most of the Indian subcontinent. Nevertheless, several indigenous kingdoms flourished,in the west and the south, such as the [[Maratha Empire]] and [[Vijayanagara Empire]]. From the sixteenth century onwards, several [[Europe|European]] countries, including [[Portugal]], [[Netherlands]], [[France]] and the [[United Kingdom]], started arriving as traders, and attempted to establish [[colony|colonies]] in the subcontinent, taking advantage of the fractious nature of relations between thousands of kingdoms. At the [[Battle of Plassey]] in [[1757]], the [[British East India Company]] defeated the local ruler Siraj-ud-Dawla and was given Bengal.  Overtaxation by the British resulted in the [[1770|Famine of 1770]]. The East India Company began wars of conquest and captured vast tracts of land in Punjab, Avadh (in modern Uttar Pradesh), Mysore (in modern Karnataka), and conquered nearly half of the land of the Indian subcontinent.  The British also began implementing social changes, such as the legal abolition of [[Sati]], due to the cumulative efforts of [[Lord William Bentinck]], the Christian evangelists, the British [[utilitarians]], [[Raja Ram Mohan Roy|Raja Rammohun Roy]], and the [[Brahmo Samaj]],<ref>Sen, Mala.  2002.

In [[1857]],a nationwide insurrection of rebelling military units and kingdoms, known as the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857|Rebellion of 1857]] broke out. Many Indian text-books term this rebellion as \"The First War of Indian Independence\". This shook the British East India Company, and caused the Queen in Great Britain to assume power and cease any further conquest of territory. After this point, there remained myriad rulers of small territories, called princely states, which existed as British protectorates. A western-style bureaucracy was raised with trained Indian people. It was during this time that the railways, telegraph and posts, military camps (cantonments) western-style educational institutes, and other industries were established. By this time the British realized that all these territories could be directly brought under the direct control of their empire. However, both the [[World Wars]] weakened Britain. The Indian freedom movement reached a crescendo between the wars when a unified territory allowed intensification of the movement, culminating  into the forging of a large powerful democratic nation. \n[[Image:Nehru Gandhi 1937 touchup.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Mahatma Gandhi]] (right) with India's first Prime Minister, [[Jawaharlal Nehru]]]]\nBy the early twentieth century, a nationwide [[Indian Independence Movement|movement for social reforms, expulsion of the British, and full native governance]] was launched by the [[Indian National Congress]], and various revolutionary groups. The movement was largely led by [[Mahatma Gandhi]], with [[Maulana Azad]], [[Gopal Krishna Gokhale]], [[Lala Lajpat Rai]], [[Bal Gangadhar Tilak]], [[Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel]], [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], [[Bipin Chandra Pal]] and [[Subhash Chandra Bose]] playing important roles. Millions protested in various mass campaigns of [[civil disobedience]] where a very prominent philosophy was of ''[[ahimsa]]'' or non-violence. There were also numerous armed attempts by the likes of the [[Bhagat Singh]], [[Udham Singh]], [[Sukhdev]], [[Rajguru]], Kshudiram Das, Benoy, Badal and Dinesh, and an army of Indian soldiers under Netaji [[Subhash Chandra Bose]] used [[revolutionary]] or [[military]] means to rid India of the British. Finally, after the [[Quit India|''Quit India'']] movement during [[World War II|WWII]] and a number of [[Bombay Mutiny|mutinies]] in the armed forces after the war, the British colonial authority ended with the emergence of India as a modern secular democratic nation-state on [[15 August]] [[1947]]. This period also sowed the seeds of another nation - [[Pakistan]], and after a blood-stained partition, the [[Muslim]] majority regions were carved out to form [[Pakistan]] with its two wings separated by thousands of miles of Indian territory. Three years later, on [[26 January]], [[1950]], India ratified a new [[Constitution of India|Constitution]], and became a republic. Modern India thus emerged as a amalgamation of western democracy while preserving its ancient heritage laid in its first foundation in 321 BCE during [[Maurya Empire|Emperor Ashoka's Mauryan Empire]].\n\nSince winning independence from Britain in 1947 and becoming a modern nation-state, India has seen numerous [[insurgencies]] in various parts of the country. However, it has addressed the regional aspirations and successfully maintained its unity and democratic structure. It continues to have unresolved border disputes with China, which escalated into the brief [[Sino-Indian War]] in 1962; and with Pakistan, which resulted in wars in [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1947|1947]], [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965|1965]], [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971|1971]] and in 1999 war in [[Kargil War|Kargil]]. The 1971 war ([[Bangladesh Liberation War]]), caused by flow of millions of East Pakistan refugees into India  resulted in the break-up of [[Pakistan]] and the independence of [[Bangladesh]]. India is a founding member of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] and the [[United Nations]] (at the time as part of British India). In 1974, India conducted an underground [[Smiling Buddha|nuclear test]]. This was followed by [[Operation Shakti|five more]] tests in 1998. Significant economic reforms beginning in 1991 have transformed India into one of the fastest-growing economies in the world.\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 0.75em; margin-bottom: 0.5em; padding: 0.5em; width:220px; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\"\n|+ '''National symbols of India'''\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left: 1em;\" | '''Flag'''\n| [[Tiranga]]                                                \n|-\n| style=\"padding-left: 1em;\" | '''Emblem'''\n| [[Emblem of India|Sarnath Lion]]\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left: 1em;\" | '''Anthem'''\n| \"[[Jana Gana Mana]]\"\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left: 1em;\" | '''Song'''\n| \"[[Vande Mataram|Vand\u0113 M\u0101taram]]\"\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left: 1em;\" | '''Animal'''\n| [[Bengal Tiger|Royal Bengal Tiger]]\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left: 1em;\" | '''Bird'''\n| [[Indian Peacock]]\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left: 1em;\" | '''Flower'''\n| [[Nelumbo nucifera|Lotus]]\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left: 1em;\" | '''Tree'''\n| [[Banyan]]\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left: 1em;\" | '''Fruit'''\n| [[Mango]]\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left: 1em;\" | '''Sport'''\n| [[Field Hockey]]\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left: 1em;\" | '''Calendar'''\n| [[Indian National Calendar|Saka]]\n|\n|}\n{{see also|Timeline of Indian history|Military history of India|Indian Independence Movement}}\n\n==Government==\n{{main|Government of India}}\nIndia is referred to as the largest democracy in the world, by virtue of the fact that it has the largest [[electorate|electing population]] among [[List of democratic states|democratic countries]]. The country has a federal form of government and a [[bicameral]] [[parliament]] operating under a [[Westminster System|Westminster-style]] parliamentary system. It has three branches of governance: the [[Legislature]], [[Executive]] and [[Judiciary]]. The [[President of India|President]] is the [[head of state]], though he has a largely ceremonial role. He is also the Supreme Commander of [[Indian military|India's armed forces]]. The President is elected indirectly by an [[electoral college]] for five-year terms. Presidential assent is needed for a Bill or Ordinance passed by the Parliament to come into force. The [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Minister]] is the de facto [[head of government]], and has most executive powers. He or she is appointed by the President, with the requirement that he or she enjoy the support of the party or coalition having more than 50% seats in the lower house. The Union Council of Ministers headed by the Prime Minister aids and advises the President on governance matters.\n[[Image:Thesouthblockdelhi.JPG|200px|thumb|The [[Secretariat Building]] in New Delhi houses the [[Indian Prime Minister's Office|Prime Minister's Office]], the ministries of [[Ministry of Defence|Defence]], External Affairs and Finance and the Home Ministry]]\nThe legislature of India is the bicameral [[Indian Parliament|Parliament]], which consists of the upper house called the [[Rajya Sabha]] (Council of States), and the lower house called the [[Lok Sabha]] (House of People). The 245-member Rajya Sabha is chosen indirectly through the state Legislative Assemblies, and has a staggered six-year term. Each state sends members to the Rajya Sabha in a proportion of its population. The 545-member Lok Sabha is directly elected (Some seats are [[Reservation in India|reserved]] for the erstwhile lower [[caste]]s) by popular vote for a five-year term (except two nominated Anglo-Indian members), and is the determinative constituent of political power and government formation. Universal adulthood suffrage is guaranteed by the Constitution for citizens above 18 years of age. The executive arm consists of the President, Vice-President, and the [[Council of Ministers]] (the [[Cabinet]] being its executive committee) headed by the Prime Minister. Any minister holding a portfolio must be a member of either house of parliament. In the Indian parliamentary system, the executive is subordinate to the legislature.\n\nIndia's independent judiciary consists of the [[Supreme Court of India|Supreme Court]], headed by the [[Chief Justice of India]]. The Supreme Court has both original jurisdiction over disputes between states and the Centre, and appellate jurisdiction over the eighteen [[High Courts of India]], and additionally, the power to declare Union and state laws null and void if in conflict with the Constitution.<ref name=\"manorama\">{{cite book | first = K.M. | last = Matthew | title = Manorama Yearbook 2003 | publisher = [[Malayala Manorama]] | year = 2006 | id = ISBN 81-89004-07-7 | pages = pg 524 }}</ref>\n\n==Politics==\n{{main|Politics of India|Foreign relations of India}}\n[[Image:IndiaMap_2_.PNG|thumb|200px|Map of India <ref name=\"loc\">The black line is the boundary as recognised by the government of India. The northern region of [[Kashmir]] is currently administered by India, Pakistan, and China (and coloured in as such). The delimiting of the three administered regions is ''not'' the international boundary but a ceasefire line demarcated in red. The boundary separating India and Pakistan is known as the [[Line of Control]], that separating India and China as the '[[Line of Actual Control]]'. Most of the state of [[Arunachal Pradesh]] is still claimed by China.</ref>]]\n\nFrom 1947 to 1974 India was ruled by the [[Indian National Congress]], the party most closely associated with the country's freedom struggle. In 1977 the [[Janata Party]] formed the first non-congress government by winning a historic election riding on public discontent during  the [[Indian Emergency|\"Emergency\"]] declared by the Congress Prime Minister [[Indira Gandhi]]. The Congress stormed back to power in 1980 and ruled again till 1989. The [[Janata Dal]] won elections in 1989, but its government managed to hold on to power for only two years with the congress again back in power by 1991. It completed its full 5 year term till 1996. Between 1996 and 1998, there was a period of political flux with the government being formed first by the right-of-centre, nationalist [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP) followed by a left-leaning [[United Front (India)|United Front]] coalition. In 1998, the BJP formed the [[National Democratic Alliance]] (NDA) with smaller regional parties, and became the first non-Congress and coalition government to complete a full five-year term. The [[Indian general elections, 2004|2004 Indian elections]] saw the left-leaning Congress party winning the largest number of seats to form a government by leading the [[United Progressive Alliance]], and supported by communist parties and those opposed to the BJP. To summarize, since 1947 the Congress has been in power for 47 years, while the other have ruled for the balance period.\n\nSince emerging as a unified nation-state, India has maintained cordial relationships with most nations. It took a lead in the 1950s in advocating the dissolution of European colonialism in Africa and Asia. During the [[Cold War]], India tried to maintain its neutrality and was one of the founding members of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]]. After the [[Sino-Indian War]] and the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965]], India's relationship with the [[Soviet Union]] warmed at the expense of ties with the [[United States]] and continued to remain so until the end of the Cold War. India has consistently refused to sign the [[CTBT]] and the [[NPT]] to maintain sovereignty over its nuclear program despite criticism and military sanctions. Recent overtures by the Indian government have strengthened India's relations with United States, China and Pakistan. In the economic sphere, India has close relationships with other developing nations of [[South America]], [[Asia]] and [[Africa]]. In recent years, India has played an influential role in the [[SAARC]]. India has been a long time supporter of the [[United Nations]], with over 55,000 [[Indian Armed Forces|Indian military]] and police personnel having served in 35 UN peace keeping operations over four continents <ref name=\"UN\">{{cite web | title = India and the United Nations | url = http://www.un.int/india/india_and_the_un_pkeeping.html | accessdate = April 22 | accessyear = 2006}}</ref>. Since the 1990s, India has been considered an emerging power on the global stage, meaning it has increasing influence on international affairs.\n\n==Administrative divisions==\n{{main|States and territories of India}}\n{{India states}}\nAdministratively, India is divided into twenty-nine states (which are further subdivided into [[districts of India|districts]]), and six [[union territories]] (or territories owned by the Central Government). All states and the union territories of Delhi and Puducherry have elected governments. The remaining union territories have centrally-appointed administrators. The states and territories are further divided into 602 districts.\n\n{{See also|List of Indian districts}}\n\n==Geography==\n{{main|Geography of India}}\n[[Image:India topo big.jpg|thumb|200px|Elevated regions in India.]] \nThe territory of India constitutes a major portion of the [[Indian subcontinent]], situated on the [[Indian Plate]], the northerly portion of the [[Indo-Australian Plate]], in [[southern Asia]].
