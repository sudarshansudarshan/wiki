CONSIDER ADDING MATERIAL TO THE 'HISTORY OF INDIA' ARTICLE.-->\n{{main|History of India}}\n[[Stone Age]] rock shelters with paintings at [[Bhimbetka]] in [[Madhya Pradesh]] are the earliest known traces of human life in present-day India. The first known permanent settlements appeared over 9,000 years ago, and gradually developed into the [[Indus Valley Civilisation]], which began around 3300 BCE and peaked between 2600 BCE and 1900 BCE. It was followed by the [[Vedic Civilisation]]. From around 550 BCE, many independent kingdoms came into being. \n\nIn the north, the [[Mauryan empire|Maurya dynasty]], which included [[Ashoka]], contributed greatly to India's cultural landscape. From 180 BCE, a series of invasions from [[Central Asia]] followed. This led to the establishment of the [[Indo-Greek]], [[Indo-Scythian]] and [[Indo-Parthian]] kingdoms in the northern [[Indian Subcontinent]], and finally the [[Kushan Empire]]. From the third century BCE, the [[Gupta|Gupta dynasty]] oversaw the period referred to as ancient India's \"Golden Age\". In the south, several dynasties, including the [[Chalukyas]], [[Cheras]], [[Cholas]], [[Kadambas]], [[Pallavas]] and [[Pandyas]] prevailed during different periods. [[Ancient Indian science and technology|Science, engineering]], [[Indian art|art]], [[Indian literature|literature]], [[Indian Mathematics|mathematics]], [[Indian science|astronomy]], [[Religion in India|religion]] and [[Indian philosophy|philosophy]] flourished under the patronage of these kings.\n\nFollowing the [[Islamic invasion of India|Islamic invasions]] from Central Asia and Persia in the seventh to the twelfth centuries, much of north and central India came under the rule of the [[Delhi Sultanate]], and later the [[Mughal empire|Mughal dynasty]], who gradually expanded their reign to much of the Indian subcontinent. Nevertheless, several indigenous kingdoms flourished, especially in the relatively sheltered south, like the [[Vijayanagara Empire]]. During mid-second millennium, several [[Europe]]an countries, including [[Portugal]], [[Netherlands]], [[France]] and the [[United Kingdom]], who initially wanted to trade with India, took advantage of the fractured kingdoms fighting each other, to establish [[colony|colonies]] in the country. In 1857, an insurrection, known locally as the [[Sepoy Mutiny|First War of Indian Independence]] against the [[British East India Company]] failed. This resulted in much of India came under the direct administrative control of the crown of the [[British Empire]]. In the early twentieth century, the prolonged, non-violent [[Indian independence movement|struggle for independence]] was led by [[Mahatma Gandhi]], widely regarded as the \"[[Father of the Nation]].\" The struggle culminated on August 15, 1947, when India gained full independence from British rule, and became a [[republic]] on January 26, 1950.\n[[Image:Sanchi2.jpg|thumb|270px|The [[Sanchi|Sanchi stupa]] in Sanchi, [[Madhya Pradesh]] built by emperor [[Ashoka]] in the 3rd century BC]]\nAs a [[ethnic|multi-ethnic]] and multi-religious nation, India has had some sectarian violence and [[insurgency|insurgencies]] in various parts of the country, but has stayed together as a vibrant democracy. It has unresolved border disputes with China, which escalated into the brief [[Sino-Indian War]] in 1962; and with Pakistan, which resulted in wars in [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1947|1947]], [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965|1965]], [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971|1971]] and in 1999 in [[Kargil War|Kargil]]. India is a founding member of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] and the [[United Nations]]. In 1974, India conducted an underground [[Smiling Buddha|nuclear test]], making it an unofficial member of the \"[[nuclear club]]\". This was followed by a series of [[Operation Shakti|five more]] tests in 1998. Significant economic reforms beginning in 1991 have transformed India into one of the fastest-growing economies in the world, and added to its global and regional clout. \n{{see also|Military history of India|Timeline of Indian history}}\n\n==Government==\n{{main|Government of India}}\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 0.75em; margin-bottom: 0.5em; padding: 0.5em; width:220px; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\"\n|+ National symbols of India\n|- \n| style=\"padding-left: 1em;\" | '''Flag'''\n| [[Tiranga]]\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left: 1em;\" | '''Emblem'''\n| [[Emblem of India|Sarnath Lion]]\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left: 1em;\" | '''Anthem'''\n| [[Jana Gana Mana]]\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left: 1em;\" | '''Song'''\n| [[Vande Mataram|Vand\u0113 M\u0101taram]]\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left: 1em;\" | '''Animal''' \n| [[Bengal Tiger|Royal Bengal Tiger]]\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left: 1em;\" | '''Bird'''\n| [[Indian Peacock]]\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left: 1em;\" | '''Flower'''\n| [[Nelumbo nucifera|Lotus]]\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left: 1em;\" | '''Tree'''\n| [[Banyan]]\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left: 1em;\" | '''Fruit'''\n| [[Mango]]\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left: 1em;\" | '''Sport'''\n| [[Field Hockey]]\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left: 1em;\" | '''Calendar'''\n| [[Indian National Calendar|Saka]]\n|\n|}\nIndia is a [[sovereignty|sovereign]], [[socialist]], [[secular]], [[democratic]] [[republic]] with a ''[[quasi]]''-federal form of government and a [[bicameral]] [[parliament]] operating under a [[Westminster System|Westminster-style]] parliamentary system. It has three branches of governance: the [[Legislature]], [[Executive]] and [[Judiciary]]. The [[President of India|President]] is the [[head of state]] and the [[Commander-in-Chief]] of [[Indian military|India's armed forces]]. The President and the [[Vice-President of India|Vice President]] are elected indirectly by an [[electoral college]] for five-year terms. \n\nThe [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Minister]] is the [[head of government]] and has the most executive powers. He or she is elected by legislators of the political party or [[coalition]] commanding a parliamentary majority, and serves a five-year term. The Constitution does not explicitly provide for a post of [[Deputy Prime Minister of India|Deputy Prime Minister]], but this option has been exercised from time to time. The legislature of India is the bicameral [[Indian Parliament|Parliament]], which consists of the upper house called the ''[[Rajya Sabha]]'' (Council of States), and the lower house called the ''[[Lok Sabha]]'' (House of the People). The 245-member ''Rajya Sabha'' is chosen indirectly through an electoral college, and has a staggered six-year term. The 545-member ''Lok Sabha'' is directly elected by popular vote for a five-year term, and is the determinative constituent of political power and government formation. All Indian citizens above the age of 18 are eligible to vote.\n\nThe executive arm consists of the President, Vice-President and the [[Council of Ministers]] (the [[Cabinet]]), headed by the [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Minister]]. Any minister holding a portfolio must be a member of either house of parliament. In the Indian parliamentary system, the executive is subordinate to the legislature. India's independent judiciary consists of the [[Supreme Court of India|Supreme Court]], headed by the [[Chief Justice of India]]. The Supreme Court has both original jurisdiction over disputes between states and the Centre, and appellate jurisdiction over the High Courts of India. There are eighteen appellate [[High Courts of India|High Courts]], each having jurisdiction over a state or a group of smaller states. Each of these states has a tiered system of lower courts. A conflict between the legislature and the judiciary is referred to the President.\n\n==Politics and foreign relations==\n{{main|Politics of India}}\n[[image:IndiaMap2.PNG|thumb|270px|Map of India.{{mn|LoC|2}}]]\nFor most of its independent history, India has been ruled by the [[Indian National Congress Party]] (INC). The party enjoyed a parliamentary majority barring two brief periods during the 1970s and late 1980s. Between 1996 and 1998, there was a period of political flux with the government being formed first by the [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] nationalist [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP) followed by a left-leaning [[United Front (India)|United Front]] coalition. In 1998, the BJP formed the [[National Democratic Alliance]] (NDA) with smaller regional parties, and became the first non-Congress government to complete a full five-year term. The [[Indian general elections, 2004|2004 Indian elections]] saw the Congress party winning the largest number of seats to form a coalition government supported by left-parties and those opposed to the BJP.\n\nIndia has had cordial relationships with most countries over much its independent history. However, much of the years following independence were overshadowed by constant tensions with Pakistan and China over territory in Kashmir and Arunachal Pradesh. During the Cold War, India tried to maintain its neutrality and was one of the founding members of the Non-Aligned Movement. After the Sino-Indian War of 1962, India's relationship with the [[Soviet Union]] warmed at the expense of its ties with the [[United States]] and continued to remain so till the end of the Cold War. Recent overtures by the Indian government have strengthened India's relations with United States, China and Pakistan. In the economic sphere, India has close relationships with other developing nations of [[South America]], [[Asia]] and [[Africa]], especially [[Brazil]] and [[Mexico]]. India was also a founding member of the United Nations and has contributed to UN operations in four continents. Over 55,000 Indian military and police personnel have served in 35 UN peace keeping operations.\n\n==States and union territories==\n{{main|States and territories of India}}\n\nIndia is divided into twenty-eight states (which are further subdivided into [[districts of India|districts]]) and seven [[union territories]]. All states and the union territories of Delhi and Pondicherry have elected governments. The remaining five union territories have centrally-appointed administrators.\n\n{{India states}}\n\n==Geography==\n{{main|Geography of India}}\n[[Image:Yumthanghimalayas.jpg|thumb|270px|The [[Himalaya]] stretch from [[Jammu and Kashmir]] in the north to [[Arunachal Pradesh]] in the far east making up most of India's eastern borders]]\nIndia is largely on the [[Indian subcontinent]] situated on the [[Indian Plate]], the northerly portion of the [[Indo-Australian Plate]], in [[southern Asia]].  India's northern and northeastern states are partially situated in the [[Himalaya|Himalayan Mountain Range]]. The rest of northern, central and eastern India consists of the fertile [[Indo-Gangetic plain]]. In the west, bordering southeast [[Pakistan]], lies the [[Thar Desert]]. The southern Indian Peninsula is almost entirely composed of the [[Deccan|Deccan plateau]], which is flanked by two hilly coastal ranges, the [[Western Ghats]] and [[Eastern Ghats]].\n\nIndia is home to several major rivers, including the [[Ganges|Ganga]], [[Brahmaputra]], [[Yamuna]], [[Godavari]], [[Kaveri]], and [[Krishna River|Krishna]]. India has three archipelagos &ndash; [[Lakshadweep]] off the southwest coast, the [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands]] volcanic island chain to the southeast, and the [[Sunderbans]] in the Gangetic Delta in [[West Bengal]] State. The Indian [[climate]] varies from [[tropical climate|tropical]] in the south to more [[temperate climate|temperate]] in the north. The Himalayan parts of India have a [[tundra]] climate. India gets most of its rains through the [[monsoon]]s.\n\n{{see also|Climate of India|Ecoregions of India|National parks of India|Geology of India}}\n\n==Economy==\n{{main|Economy of India}}\n[[Image:Bombay-Stock-Exchange.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Bombay Stock Exchange]] sensitive index is used as a determinant of the strength of the Indian economy.]]\n[[Image:Rupees1000.jpg|250px|thumb|A thousand-rupee note]]\n\nThe economy of India is the fourth-largest in the world as measured by [[purchasing power parity]] (PPP), with a [[Gross Domestic Product|GDP]] of US $3.36 [[trillion]]. {{inote|worldbank-gdp|wb-gdp-1}}  When measured in [[United States dollar|USD]] [[exchange rate|exchange-rate]] terms, it is the tenth largest in the world, with a GDP of US $691.87 billion {{inote|worldbank-gdp|wb-gdp-2}} (2004). India was the second fastest growing major economy in the world, with a GDP growth rate of 8.1% at the end of the first quarter of 2005&ndash;2006. {{inote|reuters|gdp-growthrate}} However, India's huge population results in a relatively low [[per capita]] income of $3,100 at PPP and is classified as a [[developing nation]].\n\nFor most of its independent history India has adhered to a [[socialist]]-inspired approach, with strict government control over [[private sector]] participation, [[foreign trade]], and [[foreign direct investment]]. Since the early 1990s, India has gradually opened up its markets through [[liberalization|economic reforms]] by reducing government controls on foreign trade and investment. [[Privatization|Privatisation]] of public-owned industries and opening up of certain sectors to private and foreign players has proceeded slowly amid political debate.\n\nIndia has a [[labour force]] of 496.4 million of which agriculture constitutes 60% of it, industry 17%, and services 23%. The unemployment rate is at 9%. Agricultural produce include rice, wheat, oilseed, cotton, jute, tea, sugarcane, potatoes; cattle, water buffalo, sheep, goats, poultry and fish. Major industries include textiles, chemicals, food processing, steel, transportation equipment, cement, mining, petroleum and machinery. In recent times, India has also capitalised on its large number of highly educated people who are fluent in the [[English language]] to become a major exporter of [[software]] services, [[financial]] services and [[software engineering|software engineers]]. India's major trading partners are the [[United States]], the [[European Union]], [[Japan]], [[People's Republic of China|China]] and the [[United Arab Emirates]].{{inote|trade}}\n\n[[Mumbai]] (Bombay) serves as the nation's commercial capital, with the headquarters of many financial institutions located within the city.\n\n==Demographics== \n{{main|Demographics of India}}\nIndia is the second-most populous country in the world, after China. The main determinants of social and political organisation within the highly diverse population are language, religion and [[caste]]. India's largest [[metropolitan area|metropolitan]] agglomerations are [[Mumbai]] (formerly ''Bombay''), [[Delhi]], [[Kolkata]] (formerly ''Calcutta'') and [[Chennai]] (formerly ''Madras''). India's [[literacy|literacy rate]] is 64.8% overall, 53.7% for females and 75.3% of males.{{inote|literacy}} The gender ratio is 933 females per 1000 males. The [[Work Participation Rate]] (WPR; the percentage of workers to total population) is 39.1%, with male WPR at 51.7% and female WPR at 25.6% {{inote|eu}} India's median age is 24.66, and the population growth rate is 22.32 births per 1,000.{{inote|demostats}}\n[[Image:Akshardhamindelhi.jpg|thumb|270px|The [[Akshardham]] [[Hindu]] temple, [[Delhi]] ]]\nAlthough 80.5% of the people are [[Hinduism|Hindus]], India is also home to the [[Islam by country|third-largest]] population of [[Muslim]]s in the world (13.4%; see [[Islam in India]]), after [[Indonesia]] and [[Pakistan]]. Other religious groups include [[Christianity|Christians]] (2.3%), [[Sikhism|Sikhs]] (1.84%), [[Buddhism|Buddhists]] (0.76%), [[Jainism|Jains]] (0.40%), [[Jew]]s, [[Zoroastrians]], [[Ahmadi|Ahmadi-muslims]], and [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith|Bah\u00e1'\u00ed]]s.{{inote|religion}} India is home to two major [[Languages of India|linguistic families]]: [[Indo-Aryan]] (spoken by about 74% of the population) and [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]] (spoken by about 24%) with a number of other languages from the [[Austro-Asiatic]] and [[Tibeto-Burman]] linguistic families. The constitution recognises 23 official languages{{ref|languages}}. [[Hindi]] and [[English language|English]] are used by the [[Government of India|Central Government]] for official purposes. Two [[classical languages]] native to the land are [[Sanskrit]] and [[Tamil language|Tamil]]. The number of [[Indian languages|mother tongues]] in India is as high as 1,652.{{inote|tongues}}\n\n==Culture==\n{{main|Culture of India}}\n[[Image:Taj Mahal in March 2004.jpg|thumb|270px|right|The [[Taj Mahal]] in [[Agra]] is India's most popular tourist destination.]]\n[[Image:gumpa.jpg|thumb|270px|The Gumpa dance is a mystic dance celebrated by the [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhist]] community in [[Sikkim]] during the Buddhist New Year &mdash; [[Losar]]]]\n[[Image:Lunch from Karnataka on a plantain leaf.jpg|thumb|270px|Food in south India is occasionally eaten on a plantain leaf.]]\nIndia has a rich and unique cultural heritage, and has managed to preserve its established traditions throughout history whilst absorbing customs, traditions and ideas from both invaders and immigrants. Many cultural practices, languages, customs and monuments are examples of this co-mingling over centuries. Famous monuments, such as the [[Taj Mahal]] and other examples of Islamic-inspired architecture have been inherited from the Mughal dynasty. These are the result of a syncretic tradition that combined elements from all parts of the country. Indian society is largely pluralist, multilingual and multicultural. \n\n[[Music of India|Indian music]] is represented in a wide variety of forms. The two main forms of [[Indian classical music|classical music]] are ''[[Carnatic music|Carnatic]]'' from [[South India]], and ''[[Hindustani classical music|Hindustani]]'' from [[North India]]. Popular forms of music also prevail, the most notable being [[Filmi music]]. In addition to this are the diverse traditions of [[Indian folk music|folk music]] from different parts of the country. Many [[Indian classical dance|classical dance forms]] exist, including the [[Bharatanatyam]], [[Kathakali]], [[Kathak]] and [[Manipuri]]. They often have a narrative form and are usually infused with devotional and spiritual elements. The earliest [[Indian literature|literary traditions]] in India were mostly oral, and were later transcribed. Most of these are represented by sacred works like the [[Vedas]] and the epics of the [[Mahabharatha]] and [[Ramayana]]. [[Sangam]] literature from Tamil Nadu represents some of India's oldest traditions. There have been many notable modern Indian writers, both in Indian languages and [[Indian Writing in English|in English]]. India's only [[Nobel Prize for Literature|Nobel laureate in literature]] was the [[Bengali language|Bengali]] writer [[Rabindranath Tagore]]. India produces the world's largest number of [[Cinema of India|films]] every year. The most recognisable face is that of cinema production based in Mumbai, which produces mainly commercial Hindi films, often referred to as \"[[Bollywood]]\". There are also strong cinema industries based on the [[Kannada language|Kannada]], [[Malayalam]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]] and [[Telugu language|Telugu]] languages. \n\nReligious practices of various faiths are an integral part of everyday life in society. Education is highly regarded by members of every socio-economic stratum. Traditional Indian family values are highly respected, and considered sacred, although urban families have grown to prefer a [[nuclear family]] system, owing to the socio-economic constraints imposed by the traditional [[complex family|joint family]] system. Religion in India is a very public affair, with many practices imbued with pomp and vitality accompanying their underlying spiritual qualities. A melting pot of many religions, India has a rich diversity of [[Indian festivals|festivals]], many of which are celebrated irrespective of caste and creed. The most widely known and popular celebrations include the Hindu festivals of [[Diwali]], [[Holi]], and [[Dussehra]], and the Muslim celebration of [[Eid]]. \n\nThe [[cuisine of India]] is extremely diverse, as ingredients, spices and cooking methods vary from region to region. Rice and wheat are the staple foods in the country. The country is notable for its wide variety of [[vegetarian]] and non vegetarian [[wikibooks:Cookbook:Cuisine of India|cuisine]]. Spicy food and sweets are popular in India. [[Indian Dress|Traditional dress]] in India greatly varies across the regions in its colours and styles, and depend on various factors, including climate. Popular styles of dress include the traditional [[sari]] for women and the traditional [[dhoti]] for men.\n\n==Sports and games==\n{{main|Sports in India}}\nIndia's national sport is [[field hockey]], although [[cricket]] is now the ''de facto'' national game due to its success and popularity in recent times. In some states, particularly in the northeast, football (soccer) is the most popular sport and is widely watched although India ranks above 100 in the [[FIFA World Rankings]]. India is also strongly represented in [[chess]], with several international-level players including [[Viswanathan Anand]] who was [[FIDE]] World Champion"
