It is the [[List of countries by area|seventh-largest]] country by geographical area, the [[List of countries by population|second most populous]] country, and the most populous [[liberal democracy]] in the world.  India has a coastline of over seven thousand kilometres, bounded by the [[Indian Ocean]] on the south, the [[Arabian Sea]] on the west, and the [[Bay of Bengal]] on the east. India borders [[Pakistan]] to the west;<ref name=\"Afghanistan\">The Government of India also considers Afghanistan to be a bordering country.  This is because it considers the entire state of [[Jammu and Kashmir]] to be a part of India including the portion bordering [[Afghanistan]].

In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of [[Sri Lanka]], [[Maldives]] and [[Indonesia]].\n\nHome to the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] and a region of historic [[trade route]]s and vast [[History of India|empires]], the [[Indian subcontinent]] was identified with its [[Economic history of India|commercial]] and [[Culture of India|cultural]] wealth for much of its long history.  Four major world religions, [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Jainism]] and [[Sikhism]] originated here, while [[Islam in India|Islam]], [[Christianity in India|Christianity]], [[Indian Jews|Judaism]] and [[Parsi|Zoroastrianism]] arrived in the first millennium [[Common Era|CE]] and shaped India's variegated culture.  Gradually annexed by the [[British East India Company]] from the early 18th century and colonised  by [[British raj|Great Britain]] from the mid-19th century, India became a modern [[nation-state]] in 1947 after a [[Indian independence movement|struggle for independence]] marked by widespread use of [[nonviolent resistance]] as a means of social protest. \n\nWith the world's [[List of countries by future GDP estimates (PPP)|fourth largest economy]] in purchasing power and the second fastest growing large economy, India has made rapid progress in the last decade, especially in information technology.  Although India's standard of living is projected to rise sharply in the next half-century, it currently battles [[List of countries by percentage of population living in poverty|high levels]] of [[Poverty in India|poverty]], [[Malnutrition#Statistics|persistent malnutrition]], and [[Environmental issues in India|environmental degradation]].

Oxford University Press</ref>\nThe [[Constitution of India]] and common usage in Hindi also recognise ''Bharat'' ({{Audio-IPA|Bharat.ogg|/b\u02b0\u0251\u02d0r\u0259t\u032a/}}) as an official name of equal status. A third name, ''\u0647\u0646\u062f\u0648\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646'', ''[[Hindustan]]'' (<!-- THIS SPELLING IS CORRECT.

CONSIDER ADDING MATERIAL TO THE 'HISTORY OF INDIA' ARTICLE.-->\n{{main|History of India}}\n\n[[Stone Age]] rock shelters with paintings at [[Bhimbetka]] in [[Madhya Pradesh]] are the earliest known traces of human life in India. The first known permanent settlements appeared over 9,000 years ago and gradually developed into the [[Indus Valley Civilization]], dating back to 3300 BCE in western India. It was followed by the [[Vedic Civilization|Vedic Civilisation]], which laid the foundations of [[Hinduism]] and other cultural aspects of early Indian society. From around 550 BCE, many independent kingdoms and republics known as the [[Mahajanapadas]] were established across the country. \n\nThe empire built by the [[Maurya dynasty]] under Emperor [[Ashoka]] united most of modern [[South Asia]] in third century BCE. From 180 BCE, a series of invasions from [[Central Asia]] followed, including those led by the [[Indo-Greek]]s, [[Indo-Scythian]]s, [[Indo-Parthian]]s and [[Kushan Empire|Kushans]] in the northwestern [[Indian Subcontinent]]. From the third century CE, the [[Gupta Empire|Gupta dynasty]] oversaw the period referred to as ancient India's \"Golden Age.\" While the north had larger, fewer kingdoms, the south had several dynasties such as the [[Chalukyas]], [[Cholas]], [[Pallavas]] and [[Pandyas]], which overlapped in time and space. [[Ancient Indian science and technology|Science, engineering]], [[Indian art|art]], [[Indian literature|literature]], [[Indian science|astronomy]], and [[Indian philosophy|philosophy]] flourished under the patronage of these kings.\n\n[[Image:Indischer version3.jpg|thumb|left|Paintings at the Ajanta Caves in western India.]]\nFollowing invasions from Central Asia between the tenth and twelfth centuries, much of north India came under the rule of the [[Delhi Sultanate]], and later the [[Mughal dynasty]].  Mughal emperors gradually expanded their kingdoms to cover large parts of the subcontinent. Nevertheless, several indigenous kingdoms, such as the [[Vijayanagara Empire]], flourished, especially in the south. From the sixteenth century, several [[Europe|European]] countries, including [[Portugal]], [[Netherlands]], [[France]] and the [[United Kingdom]] started arriving as traders and later took advantage of the fractious nature of relations between the kingdoms to establish [[colony|colonies]] in the country. By 1856, most of India was under the control of the [[British East India Company]]. A year later, a nationwide insurrection of rebelling military units and kingdoms, variously referred to as the [[Indian rebellion of 1857|First War of Indian Independence]] or Sepoy Mutiny, seriously challenged British rule but eventually failed. As a consequence, India came under the direct control of the [[British Crown]] as a colony of the British Empire.\n\n[[Image:Nehru Gandhi 1937 touchup.jpg|thumb|[[Mahatma Gandhi]] (right) with India's first Prime Minister, [[Jawaharlal Nehru]]]]\nIn the early twentieth century, a nationwide [[Indian Independence Movement|struggle for independence]] was launched by the [[Indian National Congress]], largely led by [[Mahatma Gandhi]]. Millions of protesters engaged in mass campaigns of [[civil disobedience]] with a commitment to ''[[ahimsa]]'' or non-violence. Finally, on [[15 August]], [[1947]], India gained independence from British rule, but not before losing its Muslim-majority areas which were carved out into the separate [[nation-state]] of [[Pakistan]]. Three years later, on [[26 January]], [[1950]], India chose to be a republic, and a new [[Constitution of India|Constitution]] came into effect.\n\nSince independence, India has seen sectarian violence and [[insurgency|insurgencies]] in various parts of the country, but has maintained its unity and democracy. It has unresolved territorial disputes with China, which escalated into the brief [[Sino-Indian War]] in 1962; and with Pakistan, which resulted in wars in [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1947|1947]], [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965|1965]], [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971|1971]] and in 1999 in [[Kargil War|Kargil]]. India is a founding member of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] and the [[United Nations]] (as part of British India). In 1974, India conducted an underground [[Smiling Buddha|nuclear test]]. This was followed by [[Operation Shakti|five more]] tests in 1998. Significant economic reforms beginning in 1991 have transformed India into one of the fastest-growing economies which have added to its global and regional clout.\n\n==Government==\n{{main|Government of India}}\n{{Indian symbols}}\n\nThe Constitution defines India as a [[sovereignty|sovereign]], [[socialism|socialist]], [[secularism|secular]], [[liberal democracy|democratic]] [[republic]]. India has a federal form of government and a [[bicameralism|bicameral]] [[parliament]] operating under a [[Westminster System|Westminster-style]] parliamentary system. It has three branches of governance: the [[Legislature]], [[Executive]], and [[Judiciary]].\n\nThe [[President of India]] is the official [[head of state]] elected indirectly by an [[electoral college]] for a five-year term. The [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Minister]] is, however, the ''de facto'' [[head of government]] and exercises most executive powers. The Prime Minister is appointed by the President, with the requirement that they enjoy the support of the party or coalition securing the majority of seats in the lower house of Parliament.\n\nThe legislature of India is the bicameral [[Indian Parliament|Parliament]], which consists of the upper house called the [[Rajya Sabha]] (Council of States), and the lower house called the [[Lok Sabha]] (House of People). The Rajya Sabha has upto 250 members holding staggered six year terms. Most are elected indirectly by the [[States and territories of India|state and territorial]] legislatures in proportion to the state's population. The Lok Sabha's 545 members are directly elected by popular vote to represent individual [[constituency|constituencies]] for five year terms.\n\nThe executive branch consists of the President, Vice-President, and the [[Council of Ministers]] (the [[Cabinet]] being its executive committee) headed by the Prime Minister. Any minister holding a portfolio must be a member of either house of parliament. In the Indian parliamentary system, the executive is subordinate to the legislature, with the Prime Minister and his Council being directly responsible to the lower house of the parliament.<ref name=\"manorama\">{{cite book | first = K.M. | last = Matthew | title = Manorama Yearbook 2003 | publisher = [[Malayala Manorama]] | year = 2006 | id = ISBN 81-89004-07-7 | pages = pg 524 }}</ref> \n\nIndia's independent judiciary consists of the [[Supreme Court of India|Supreme Court]], headed by the [[Chief Justice of India]].

State politics have been dominated by several national parties including INC, [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP), [[Communist Party of India]] (CPI) and various regional parties.  From 1950 to 1990, the INC enjoyed a parliamentary majority barring two brief periods. The INC was out of power between 1977 and 1980, when the [[Janata Party]] won the election owing to public discontent with the [[Indian Emergency (1975-1977)|\"Emergency\"]] declared by the then Prime Minister [[Indira Gandhi]]. A [[Janata Dal]] coalition, called the [[National Front (India)|National Front]], won elections in 1989 but managed to stay in power for only two years. The years 1996-1998 were a period of turmoil in the federal government with several short-lived alliances holding sway. The BJP formed a government briefly in 1996, followed by the [[United Front (India)|United Front]] coalition. In 1998, the BJP formed the [[National Democratic Alliance (India)|National Democratic Alliance]] (NDA) with several regional parties, and became the first non-Congress government to complete a full five-year term. In the [[Indian general elections, 2004|2004 Indian elections]] the Indian National Congress won the largest number of Lok Sabha seats and formed a government with a coalition called the [[United Progressive Alliance]], supported by a various left-leaning parties and members opposed to the BJP.\n\n==Military and foreign relations==\n{{main|Military of India|Foreign relations of India}}\n[[Image:Agni-II missile (Republic Day Parade 2004).jpeg|thumb|right|An Indian-developed [[Agni missile system|Agni-II ballistic missile]] during a [[Republic Day Parade|Republic Day parade]] held in 2004.]]\n\nSince Independence in 1947, India has maintained cordial relationships with most nations. It took a leading role in the 1950s by advocating the independence of [[List of former European colonies|European colonies]] in Africa and Asia. India is  one of the founding members of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]]. After the [[Sino-Indian War]] and the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965]], India's relationship with the [[Soviet Union]] warmed at the expense of ties with the [[United States]] and continued to remain so until the end of the Cold War. India has fought [[Indo-Pakistani Wars|several wars with Pakistan]], primarily over Kashmir. India has also fought an additional war with Pakistan for the [[Bangladesh Liberation War|the liberation of Bangladesh]] in 1971.  \n\nDespite criticism and military sanctions, India has consistently refused to sign the [[CTBT]] and the [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty|NPT]], preferring instead to maintain sovereignty over its nuclear program. Recent overtures by the Indian government have strengthened relations with the United States, China, and Pakistan. In the economic sphere, India has close relationships with other developing nations in [[South America]], Asia, and [[Africa]]. In recent years, India has played an influential role in the [[ASEAN]], [[SAARC]], and the [[WTO]]. India has been a long time supporter of the [[United Nations]], with over 55,000 [[Indian Armed Forces|Indian military]] and police personnel having served in 35 UN peace keeping operations deployed across four continents.<ref name=\"UN\">{{cite web | title = India and the United Nations | url = http://www.un.int/india/india_and_the_un_pkeeping.html | accessdate = April 22 | accessyear = 2006}}</ref>\n\nIndia became a nuclear state in 1998 by successfully conducting underground nuclear tests. This was followed by international military sanctions which were gradually withdrawn after September 2001. Recently, India concluded a nuclear deal with [[United States]] that would allow the United States to supply civilian nuclear technology to India and nuclear fuel to Indian reactors. India has adopted a [[No first use]] nuclear policy.\n\nIndia maintains the third largest military force in the world, which consists of the [[Indian Army|army]], and the [[Indian Navy|navy]], [[Indian Air Force|air force]]. Auxiliary forces such as the [[Indian Paramilitary Forces]], the [[Indian Coast Guard]], and the [[Strategic Forces Command]] also come under the Indian military. The [[President of India]] is the supreme commander of the Indian armed forces.\n\n==States and union territories==\n{{main|States and territories of India}}\n\nIndia is a union of twenty-eight states and seven federally-governed [[union territories]]. All states, the National Capital Territory of Delhi and the union territory of Pondicherry have elected governments. The other five union territories have centrally-appointed administrators.\n\n{{India states}}\n\nAll states and union territories are subdivided into districts. In larger states, districts may be grouped together to form a division.\n\n==Geography==\n{{main|Geography of India}}\n[[Image:India topo big.jpg|thumb|Elevated regions in India]] \nIndia constitutes the major portion of the [[Indian subcontinent]], which sits atop the [[Indian Plate]] and the northwesterly portion of the [[Indo-Australian Plate]]. India's northern and north-eastern states are partially situated in the [[Himalayas|Himalayan Range]]. The rest of northern, central, and eastern India consists of the fertile [[Indo-Gangetic Plain]]. In the west, bordering southeastern Pakistan, lies the [[Thar Desert]]. Southern India is almost entirely composed of the peninsular [[Deccan|Deccan plateau]], which is flanked by two hilly coastal ranges, the [[Western Ghats]] and the [[Eastern Ghats]].\n\nIndia is home to several major rivers, including the [[Ganges River|Ganges]], the [[Brahmaputra River|Brahmaputra]], the [[Yamuna]], the [[Godavari River|Godavari]], the [[Kaveri River|Kaveri]], the [[Narmada River|Narmada]], and the [[Krishna River|Krishna]]. India has three archipelagos &mdash; [[Lakshadweep]], which lies off the southwestern coast; the volcanic [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands]] island chain to the southeast, and the [[Sunderbans]] in the [[Ganges Delta]] of West Bengal.\n\nThe climate in India varies from [[tropical climate|tropical]] in the south to more [[temperate climate|temperate]] in the Himalayan north, where elevated regions receive sustained winter snowfall. India's climate is strongly influenced by the Himalayas and the Thar Desert. The Himalayas, along with the [[Hindu Kush]] mountains in Pakistan, prevent cold Central Asian [[katabatic wind]]s from blowing in. This keeps the bulk of the Indian subcontinent warmer than most locations at similar latitudes. The Thar Desert is responsible for attracting the moisture-laden [[Monsoon#Southwest Summer Monsoon|summer monsoon]] winds that, between June and September, provide most of India's rainfall.\n\n== Flora and fauna ==\n[[Image:Trachypithecus-geei-cropped.jpg|thumb|right|Now the world's rarest monkey, the [[Gee's Golden Langur|golden langur]] typifies the precarious survival of much of India's megafauna.]]<!--[[Image:Panthera tigris cropped.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Bengal Tiger|Bengal tiger]].]]-->\n{{main|Fauna of India|Flora of India|Wildlife of India}}\nIndia, lying within the [[Indomalaya ecozone]], hosts significant [[biodiversity]]; it is home to 7.6% of all [[mammal]]ian, 12.6% of [[birds|avian]], 6.2% of [[reptile|reptilian]], and 6.0% of [[flowering plant]] species.<ref name=unep>Indira Gandhi Conservation Monitoring Centre (IGCMC), New Delhi and the [http://www.unep-wcmc.org/ United Nations Environmental Program (UNEP), World Conservation Monitoring Center], Cambridge, UK.  2001.

Many Indian cultural practices, languages, customs, and monuments are examples of this co-mingling over centuries. Famous monuments, such as the [[Taj Mahal]] and other examples of [[Islamic architecture|Islamic-inspired architecture]], have been inherited from the Mughal dynasty. These are the result of traditions that combined elements from all parts of the country.\n\n[[Music of India|Indian music]] is highly diversified. [[Indian classical music|Classical music]] is mainly split between the [[North India]]n [[Hindustani classical music|Hindustani]] and [[South India]]n [[Carnatic music|Carnatic]] traditions. Highly regionalised forms of popular music include [[Filmi music|Filmi]] and [[Indian folk music|folk music]] like [[Bhangra]]. Many [[Indian classical dance|classical dance forms]] exist, including [[Bharatanatyam]], [[Kathakali]], [[Kathak]], [[Kuchipudi]], [[Manipuri dance|Manipuri]], [[Odissi]] and [[Yakshagana]]. They often have a narrative form and are usually infused with devotional and spiritual elements. \n\nThe earliest [[Indian literature|literary traditions]] in India were mostly oral, and were only later transcribed. Most of these are represented by religious texts such as the [[Vedas]], the [[Mahabharata]], and the [[Ramayana]]; [[Sangam]] literature from Tamil Nadu is among India's oldest.   The many notable Indian writers of the modern era, using both Indian languages and [[Indian Writing in English|in English]], include [[Rabindranath Tagore]]. \nThe [[Cinema of India|Indian film industry]] is the world's most prolific; its most recognisable face is the Mumbai-based \"[[Bollywood]]\", which produces mainly Hindi films. Other strong cinema industries are based on the [[Tollywood|Telugu]], [[Cinema of Karnataka|Kannada]], [[Malayalam cinema|Malayalam]], [[Tamil cinema|Tamil]], and [[Bengali cinema|Bengali]], [[Marathi]] languages. \n\n[[Image:Toda Hut.JPG|thumb|A [[Toda people|Toda]] tribal hut.]]\nThe [[cuisine of India]] is extremely diverse, as ingredients, spices and cooking methods vary from region to region. [[Rice]] and [[wheat]] are the nation's main staple foods. The country is notable for its wide variety of [[vegetarian]] and non-vegetarian [[wikibooks:Cookbook:Cuisine of India|cuisine]]. Spicy food and sweets are popular in India. Traditional [[Indian dress]] greatly varies across the regions in its colours and styles, and depend on various factors, including climate. Popular styles of dress include the [[Sari]] for women and the [[Lungi]] or [[Dhoti]] for men.\n\nIndia's national sport is [[field hockey]], although [[cricket]] is the most popular sport in India. In some states, particularly those in the [[North-East India|northeast]] and the coastal states of [[West Bengal]], [[Goa]] and [[Kerala]], [[football (soccer)|football]] is the more popular sport. In recent times, [[tennis]] has gained popularity. [[Chess]], commonly held to have originated in India, is also gaining popularity with the rise of the number of recognised Indian [[International Grandmaster|grandmasters]]. Traditional sports include [[Kabaddi]], [[Kho-Kho]], and [[Gilli-Danda]], which are played nationwide. India is home to the age-old discipline of [[Yoga]], and also to the ancient martial art, [[Kalari Payattu]].\n\n[[Holidays in India|Indian festivals]] come in a vast variety; many are celebrated irrespective of caste and creed. The most popular holidays are [[Diwali]], [[Holi]], [[Onam]], [[Sankranti]]/[[Pongal]], [[Gudi Padwa]]/[[Ugadi]], the two [[Eid]]s, [[Christmas]], and [[Vaisakhi]]. India has three national holidays. Other sets of holidays, varying between nine and twelve, are officially observed in the individual states. Religious practices are an integral part of everyday life and are a very public affair. Traditional Indian family values are highly respected, although urban families now prefer a nuclear family system due to the socio-economic constraints imposed by the traditional joint family system.\n\n==See also==\n\n{{Indian topics}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Spoken Wikipedia|India.ogg|2006-03-07}}\n{{sisterlinks|India}}\n{{portal|India|Emblem of India.svg}}\n; Government\n* [http://india.gov.in/ Official entry portal] of the Government of India\n* [http://www.nic.in Official directory] of Indian Government websites\n; General references\n* {{CIA_World_Factbook_link|in|India}}\n* [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]] entry on [http://www.britannica.com/nations/India India]\n* [[BBC News|BBC]] country profile of [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/country_profiles/1154019.stm India]\n{{wikimapia|20632784|83671875|4|India}}\n; Other\n* {{wikitravel|India}}\n* {{dmoz|Regional/Asia/India/|India}}\n\n<!-- ==============================({{NoMoreLinks}})============================== -->\n<!-- DO NOT ADD MORE LINKS TO THIS ARTICLE.
