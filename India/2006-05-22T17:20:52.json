CONSIDER ADDING MATERIAL TO THE 'HISTORY OF INDIA' ARTICLE.-->\n{{main|History of India}}\n\n[[Stone Age]] rock shelters with paintings at [[Bhimbetka]] in [[Madhya Pradesh]] are the earliest known traces of human life in India. The first known permanent settlements appeared over 9,000 years ago, and gradually developed into the [[Indus Valley Civilization]], which began around 3300 BCE and peaked between 2600 BCE and 1900 BCE. Cities of this culture exhibit advanced urban features and scientific accomplishments such as superior civil drainage systems. It was followed by the [[Vedic Civilisation]] which laid the foundations of [[Hinduism]] and other cultural aspects. In Vedic classical texts and [[Hindu mythology]], the land is referred to as ''[[Bharatavarsha|{{IAST|Bh\u0101ratavarsha}}]]''. From around 550 BCE, many independent kingdoms and republics known as the [[Mahajanapadas|{{IAST|Mah\u0101janapadas}}]] spread across the country. The country was witnessing a complex religious culture, with the birth of [[Jainism]] and [[Buddhism]]. Ancient universities arose in [[Taxila]], [[Nalanda]], [[Pataliputra]] and [[Ujjain]].\n\nThe empire built by the [[Maurya dynasty]] under Emperor [[Ashoka]] united most of modern [[South Asia]]. From 180 BCE, a series of invasions from [[Central Asia]] followed including the [[Indo-Greek]]s, [[Indo-Scythian]]s, [[Indo-Parthian]]s and [[Kushan Empire|Kushans]] in the northwestern [[Indian Subcontinent]]. From the third century BCE, the [[Gupta|Gupta dynasty]] oversaw the period referred to as ancient India's \"Golden Age.\" In the south, several dynasties, including the [[Chalukyas]], [[Rashtrakutas]], [[Cheras]], [[Cholas]], [[Pallavas]] and [[Pandyas]] prevailed during different periods. [[Ancient Indian science and technology|Science, engineering]], [[Indian art|art]], [[Indian literature|literature]], [[Indian Mathematics|mathematics]], [[Indian science|astronomy]], [[Religion in India|religion]] and [[Indian philosophy|philosophy]] flourished under the patronage of these kings.\n[[Image:Sanchi2.jpg|thumb|right|270px|The [[Sanchi|Sanchi stupa]] in Sanchi, [[Madhya Pradesh]] built by emperor [[Ashoka]] in the 3rd century BC]]\nFollowing the invasions from Central Asia, between the tenth to the twelfth centuries, much of north India came under the rule of the [[Delhi Sultanate]], [[Mughal empire|Mughal dynasty]] and later the [[Marathas]] who gradually expanded their reign throughout the Indian subcontinent. Nevertheless, several indigenous kingdoms flourished, especially in the south, like the [[Vijayanagara Empire]]. During the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, several [[Europe|European]] countries, including [[Portugal]], [[Netherlands]], [[France]] and the [[United Kingdom]], initially arrived as traders, later took advantage of the fractious nature of relations between the kingdoms, to establish [[colony|colonies]] in the country. By 1856, most of India came under control of the [[British East India Company]], with the capital at [[Calcutta]]. A year later, a nationwide insurrection of rebelling military units and kingdoms, known locally as the [[Indian rebellion of 1857|First War of Indian Independence known as the Sepoy Mutiny In British Texts]] broke out, which failed even as it seriously challenged British rule. India thus came under the direct control of the [[British Empire]].\n\n[[Image:Nehru Gandhi 1937 touchup.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Mahatma Gandhi]] (right) with India's first Prime Minister, Pandit [[Jawaharlal Nehru]].]]\nIn the early twentieth century, a nationwide [[Indian Independence Movement|struggle for independence]] was launched by the [[Indian National Congress]], led by Indians such as [[Bal Gangadhar Tilak]], [[Mahatma Gandhi]], [[Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel]] and [[Jawaharlal Nehru]]. Millions of protestors would engage in mass campaigns of [[civil disobedience]] with a commitment to ''[[ahimsa]]'' - total non-violence. Gandhi would lead Indians in the [[Dandi Salt March]] to defy the salt tax, and an all-out revolt in 1942 demanding that the British ''[[Quit India]]''. India gained independence on August 15th, 1947 - 565 princely states united with British-era provinces to form a united nation, but not before the Muslim-majority provinces were [[Partition of India|partitioned]] as a result of the separatist campaign led by the [[Muslim League]] to form Pakistan. Since independence, India has seen sectarian violence and [[insurgency|insurgencies]] in various parts of the country, but has maintained its unity and democracy. It has unresolved border disputes with China, which escalated into the brief [[Sino-Indian War]] in 1962; and with Pakistan, which resulted in wars in [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1947|1947]], [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965|1965]], [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971|1971]] and in 1999 in [[Kargil War|Kargil]]. India is a founding member of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] and the [[United Nations]]. In 1974, India conducted an underground [[Smiling Buddha|nuclear test]]. This was followed by [[Operation Shakti|five more]] tests in 1998. Significant economic reforms beginning in 1991 have transformed India into one of the fastest-growing economies in the world, and added to its global and regional clout.\n{{see also|Military history of India|Timeline of Indian history}}\n\n==Government==\n{{main|Government of India}}\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 0.75em; margin-bottom: 0.5em; padding: 0.5em; width:220px; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\"\n|+ '''National symbols of India'''\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left: 1em;\" | '''Flag'''\n| [[Tiranga]]\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left: 1em;\" | '''Emblem'''\n| [[Emblem of India|Sarnath Lion]]\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left: 1em;\" | '''Anthem'''\n| \"[[Jana Gana Mana]]\"\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left: 1em;\" | '''Song'''\n| \"[[Vande Mataram|Vand\u0113 M\u0101taram]]\"\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left: 1em;\" | '''Animal'''\n| [[Bengal Tiger|Royal Bengal Tiger]]\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left: 1em;\" | '''Bird'''\n| [[Indian Peacock]]\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left: 1em;\" | '''Flower'''\n| [[Nelumbo nucifera|Lotus]]\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left: 1em;\" | '''Tree'''\n| [[Banyan]]\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left: 1em;\" | '''Fruit'''\n| [[Mango]]\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left: 1em;\" | '''Sport'''\n| [[Field Hockey]]\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left: 1em;\" | '''Calendar'''\n| [[Indian National Calendar|Saka]]\n|\n|}\nIndia is a [[sovereignty|sovereign]], [[socialist]], [[secular]], [[democratic]] [[republic]]. The [[Constitution of India]], which came into force on 26th January 1950, is the supreme law of the land. India has a federal form of government (with a high degree of [[centralization]]) and a [[bicameral]] [[parliament]] operating under a [[Westminster System|Westminster-style]] parliamentary system. It has three branches of governance: the [[Legislature]], [[Executive]] and [[Judiciary]]. \n\nFor the Union government of India, the [[President of India|President]] is the [[head of state]], and has a largely ceremonial role, including interpreting the constitution, signing laws into action, issuing administrative orders and issuing pardons. He is also the [[Commander-in-Chief]] of [[Indian military|India's  armed forces]]. The President is elected indirectly by an [[electoral college]] for five-year terms, consisting of the members of Parliament and of all the state Legislative Assemblies in a very complicated scheme. The [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Minister]] is the ''de facto'' [[head of government]], and has most executive powers. He or she is appointed by the President. As a general rule and rather a very strict convention, the President appoints only that person as the Prime Minister who enjoys the support of the majority of the members in the Lok Sabha (the lower house of the Parliament), and serves a five-year term, with re-selection possible.\n\nThe legislature of India is the bicameral [[Indian Parliament|Parliament]] (''Sansad''), which consists of the upper house called the ''[[Rajya Sabha]]'' (Council of States), and the lower house called the ''[[Lok Sabha]]'' (House of People). The 245-member ''Rajya Sabha'' is chosen indirectly through the state Legislative Assemblies, and has a staggered six-year term. Each state sends members to the Rajya Sabha in a proportion of its population (unlike the [[Senate]] of the [[United States]]). The 545-member ''Lok Sabha'' is directly elected by popular vote for a five-year term, and is the determinative constituent of political power and government formation. All Indian citizens above age 18 are eligible to vote. The Lok Sabha is subject to dissolution by the President but the Rajya Sabha is not.\n\nThe executive arm consists of the '''President''', Vice-President and the [[Council of Ministers]] (the [[Cabinet]] being its executive committee), headed by the Prime Minister. Any minister holding a portfolio must be a member of either house of parliament. In the Indian parliamentary system, the executive is subordinate to the legislature. All ministers are appointed and dismissed by the President on the advice of the Prime Minister. The President is bound to follow the advice of the Council of Ministers while making any executive decision or order, but may ask the Council to reconsider its decision once.\n\nIndia's independent judiciary consists of the [[Supreme Court of India|Supreme Court]], headed by the [[Chief Justice of India]]\u2014all appointed by the President. The Supreme Court has both original jurisdiction over disputes between states and the Centre, and appellate jurisdiction over the High Courts of India. Each of these states has a tiered system of lower courts. The Supreme Court has the right to declare laws and orders passed by the government as ''null'' and ''void'' if they are in conflict with the Constitution. [[Impeachment]] of the President and the judges of the Supreme Court requires a two-thirds majority in each house of the Parliament. Removal of the Prime Minister requires a simple majority in the [[Lok Sabha]].\n\nThe federating states (''rajya'') of India have a [[governor]] as the titular head of the province, a [[Chief Minister]] as the real head of the government (with his council of ministers) and a directly-elected ''Vidhan Sabha'' (Legislative Assembly) to which he is responsible, and optionally an upper house ''Vidhan Parishad'' (Legislative Council). The highest court of a state is its High court, whose judges are appointed by the President and '''not''' by the governor. There are 18 appellate High Courts, each having jurisdiction over a state or a group of smaller states. No state has its own Constitution except [[Jammu and Kashmir]]. No state has a separate citizenship (in Jammu and Kashmir, there is a constitutional provision of ''permanent resident of the state'').{{inote|Source: Manorama Yearbook 2006|Manorama-2}}\n\n==Politics==\n{{main articles|[[Politics of India]], [[Foreign relations of India]]}}\n[[image:IndiaMap2.PNG|thumb|270px|Map of India <ref name=\"loc\">The black line is the boundary as recognised by the government of India. The northern region of [[Kashmir]] is currently administered by India, Pakistan, and China (and coloured in as such). The delimiting of the three administered regions is ''not'' the international boundary but a ceasefire line demarcated in red. The boundary separating India and Pakistan is known as the [[Line of Control]], that separating India and China as the '[[Line of Actual Control]]'. Most of the state of [[Arunachal Pradesh]] is still claimed by China.</ref>.]]\nFor most of its independent history, India has been ruled by the [[Indian National Congress]]. The party enjoyed a parliamentary majority barring two brief periods during the 1970s and late 1980s. This rule was interrupted between 1977 to 1980, when the [[Janata Party]] coalition won the election owing to public discontent with the [[Indian Emergency|\"Emergency\"]] declared by the then Prime Minister [[Indira Gandhi]]. The [[Janata Dal]] won elections in 1989, but its government managed to hold on to power for only two years. Between 1996 and 1998, there was a period of political flux with the government being formed first by the [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] nationalist [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] followed by a left-leaning [[United Front (India)|United Front]] coalition. In 1998, the BJP formed the [[National Democratic Alliance]] (NDA) with smaller regional parties, and became the first non-Congress and coalition government to complete a full five-year term. The [[Indian general elections, 2004|2004 Indian elections]] saw the Congress party winning the largest number of seats to form a government leading the [[United Progressive Alliance]], and supported by left-parties and those opposed to the BJP.\n\nSince independence, India has maintained cordial relationships with most nations. It took a lead in the 1950s in advocating the independence of European colonies in Africa and Asia. During the [[Cold War]], India tried to maintain its neutrality and was one of the founding members of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]]. After the [[Sino-Indian War]] and the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965]], India's relationship with the [[Soviet Union]] warmed at the expense of ties with the [[United States]] and continued to remain so till the end of the Cold War. India has consistently refused to sign the [[CTBT]] and the [[NPT]] to maintain sovereignty over its nuclear program despite criticism and military sanctions from leading nations. Recent overtures by the Indian government have strengthened India's relations with United States, China and Pakistan. In the economic sphere, India has close relationships with other developing nations of [[South America]], [[Asia]] and [[Africa]], especially [[Brazil]] and [[Mexico]]. In recent years, India has played an influential role in the [[ASEAN]], [[SAARC]] and the [[WTO]], and it is a signatory to the landmark [[South Asia Free Trade Agreement]]. India has been a long time supporter of the [[United Nations]], with over 55,000 [[Indian Armed Forces|Indian military]] and police personnel having served in 35 UN peace keeping operations over four continents <ref name=\"UN\">{{cite web | title = India and the United Nations | url = http://www.un.int/india/india_and_the_un_pkeeping.html | accessdate = April 22 | accessyear = 2006}}</ref>.\n\n==Administrative Divisions==\n{{main|States and territories of India}}\n\nIndia is divided into twenty-eight states (which are further subdivided into [[districts of India|districts]]) and seven [[union territories]]. All states and the union territories of Delhi and Pondicherry have elected governments. The remaining five union territories have centrally-appointed administrators.\n\n{{India states}}\n\n==Geography==\n{{main|Geography of India}}\n[[Image:Yumthanghimalayas.jpg|thumb|270px|The [[Himalaya]]s stretch from [[Jammu and Kashmir]] in the north to [[Arunachal Pradesh]] in the far east making up most of India's eastern borders]]\nThe territory of India constitutes a major portion of the [[Indian subcontinent]], situated on the [[Indian Plate]], the northerly portion of the [[Indo-Australian Plate]], in [[southern Asia]]. India's northern and northeastern states are partially situated in the [[Himalaya|Himalayan Mountain Range]]. The rest of northern, central and eastern India consists of the fertile [[Indo-Gangetic plain]]. In the west, bordering southeast [[Pakistan]], lies the [[Thar Desert]]. The southern Indian Peninsula is almost entirely composed of the [[Deccan|Deccan plateau]], which is flanked by two hilly coastal ranges, the [[Western Ghats]] and [[Eastern Ghats]].\n\nIndia is home to several major rivers, including the [[Ganges|Ganga]], [[Brahmaputra]], [[Yamuna]], [[Godavari]], [[Kaveri]], [[Narmada]], and [[Krishna River|Krishna]]. India has three archipelagos &ndash; [[Lakshadweep]] off the southwest coast, the [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands]] volcanic island chain to the southeast, and the [[Sunderbans]] in the Gangetic delta in West Bengal.\n\nClimate in India varies from [[tropical climate|tropical]] in the south to more [[temperate climate|temperate]] in the Himalayan north, with elevated regions in the north receiving sustained snowfall in winters. India's climate is strongly influenced by the Himalayas and the Thar Desert. The Himalayas, along with the [[Hindu Kush]] mountains in Pakistan, provide a barrier to the cold winds from Central Asia. This keeps most of the Indian subcontinent warmer than most locations in similar latitudes. The Thar Desert is responsible for attracting the moisture laden [[southwest monsoon]] winds in that provide most of India's rainfall between June to September.\n\n{{see also|Climate of India|Ecoregions of India|Geology of India}}\n\n==Economy==\n{{main|Economy of India}}\n[[Image:Bombay-Stock-Exchange.jpg|thumb|180px|The [[Bombay Stock Exchange]] sensitive index is used as a determinant of the strength of the Indian economy.]]\n\nThe economy of India is the [[List of countries by GDP (PPP)|fourth largest]] in the world as measured by [[purchasing power parity]] (PPP), with a [[Gross Domestic Product|GDP]] of US $3.63 [[trillion]]. When measured in [[United States dollar|USD]] [[exchange rate|exchange-rate]] terms, it is the [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|twelfth largest]] in the world, with a GDP of US $775 billion (2005). India is the second fastest growing major economy in the world, with a GDP growth rate of 8.1% at the end of the first quarter of 2005&ndash;2006. However, India's huge population results in a relatively low [[per capita]] income of $3,400 at PPP and is classified as a [[developing nation]].{{inote|Source: CIA-Factbook: http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/in.html|CIA-2}}\n\nFor most of its independent history India has adhered to a socialist-inspired approach, with strict government control over [[private sector]] participation, [[foreign trade]] [http://www.shakun.com/ (View official updates on the Indian Foreign Trade Policy)], and [[foreign direct investment]]. Since the early 1990s, India has gradually opened up its markets through [[liberalization|economic reforms]] by reducing government controls on foreign trade and investment. [[Privatization|Privatisation]] of public-owned industries and opening up of certain sectors to private and foreign players has proceeded slowly amid political debate.\n\nIndia has a [[labour force]] of 496.4 million of which agriculture constitutes 60%, industry 17%, and services 23%. India's agricultural produce include rice, wheat, oilseed, cotton, jute, tea, sugarcane, potatoes; cattle, water buffalo, sheep, goats, poultry and fish. Major industries include textiles, chemicals, food processing, steel, transportation equipment, cement, mining, petroleum and machinery <ref name=\"CIA\">{{cite web | title = CIA Factbook : India | work = CIA Factbook | url = http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/in.html | accessdate = April 15 | accessyear = 2006}}</ref>.\n\nIn recent times, India has also capitalised on its large number of educated population who are fluent in the [[English language]] to become an important location for global companies [[outsourcing]] [[customer service]] and [[technical support]] [[call center]]s. It is also a major exporter of [[software]], [[financial]], [[research]] and technology services.

Increasingly, there is strong evidence to support the view that most Indians are descendents of ancient immigrants who came to region over 12,000 years ago during the [[Pleistocene]] epoch and that the impact of later invasions may have been more minimal than previously believed. <ref name=\"stanfordgeneticstudy\">{{cite web | title = The Genetic Heritage of the Earliest Settlers Persists Both in Indian Tribal\nand Caste Populations | work = Department of Genetic Studies, Stanford University | url = http://hpgl.stanford.edu/publications/AJHG_2003_v72_p313-332.pdf | accessdate = May 22 | accessyear = 2006}}</ref> <ref name=\"oxfordgeneticstudy\">{{cite web | title = Most of the extant mtDNA boundaries in South and Southwest Asia were likely shaped during the initial settlement of Eurasia by anatomically modern humans | work = University of Oxford | url =  http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/5/26 | accessdate = May 22 | accessyear = 2006}}</ref>  Thus, though the [[caste]] system persists in India and seeks to classify and segregate groups, although illegal under the Indian Constitution, there is little evidence to support any substantial differences between caste groups other than those socially constructed.<ref name=\"caste\">{{cite web | title = US Library of Congress Country Studies: India, Caste and Class | work = US Library of Congress Country Studies | url = http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+in0089) | accessdate = May 22 | accessyear = 2006}}</ref>\n\n{{see also|List of Indian languages by total speakers|Religion in India|Indian Caste System}}\n\n==Languages==\n{{main|Languages of India}}\nIndia is home to two major [[Languages of India|linguistic families]]: [[Indo-European]] (whose branch [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]] is spoken by about 74% of the population) and [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]] (spoken by about 24%). Other languages spoken in India come from the [[Austro-Asiatic]] and [[Tibeto-Burman]] linguistic families. Two [[classical languages]] native to the land are [[Sanskrit]] and [[Tamil language|Tamil]]. The number of [[Indian languages|mother tongues]] in India is as high as 1,652.\n\nArticle 343 of the [[Indian Constitution]] recognises [[Hindi language|Hindi]] in [[Devanagari|D\u0113van\u0101gari script]] as the [[official language]] of the union <ref name=article343>[http://www.constitution.org/cons/india/p17343.html \"Part XVII, Chapter 1. Article 343\"]. Constitution of India. Government of India.</ref>; the Constitution also allows for the continuation of use of the [[English language]] for official purposes. Article 345 provides constitutional recognition to \"regional languages\" of the union to include any language adopted by a [[State Legislature]] as the official language of that state. Until the Twenty-First Amendment of the Constitution in 1967, the country recognised 14 official regional languages. The Eighth Schedule and the Seventy-First Amendment provided for the inclusion of [[Sindhi]], [[Konkani]], [[Manipuri]] and [[Nepali]], thereby increasing the number of official regional languages of India to 18 <ref name=constlanguages>[http://www.us-english.org/foundation/research/olp/viewResearch.asp?CID=54&TID=1 \"Legislation: Legislation dealing with the use of lanaguages\"].

Many cultural practices, languages, customs and monuments are examples of this co-mingling over centuries. Famous monuments, such as the [[Taj Mahal]] and other examples of [[Islamic architecture|Islamic-inspired architecture]] have been inherited from the Mughal dynasty. These are the result of a syncretic tradition that combined elements from all parts of the country.\n\n[[Music of India|Indian music]] is represented in a wide variety of forms. The two main forms of [[Indian classical music|classical music]] are ''[[Carnatic music|Carnatic]]'' from [[South India]], and ''[[Hindustani classical music|Hindustani]]'' from [[North India]]. Popular forms of music also prevail, the most notable being [[Filmi music]]. In addition to this are the diverse traditions of [[Indian folk music|folk music]] from different parts of the country. Many [[Indian classical dance|classical dance forms]] exist, including the [[Bharatanatyam]], [[Kathakali]], [[Kathak]] and [[Manipuri dance|Manipuri]]. They often have a narrative form and are usually infused with devotional and spiritual elements. The earliest [[Indian literature|literary traditions]] in India were mostly oral, and were later transcribed. Most of these are represented by sacred works like the [[Vedas]] and the epics of the [[Mahabharata]] and [[Ramayana]]. [[Sangam]] literature from Tamil Nadu represents some of India's oldest traditions. There have been many notable modern Indian writers, both in Indian languages and [[Indian Writing in English|in English]]. India's only [[Nobel Prize for Literature|Nobel laureate in literature]] was the [[Bengali language|Bengali]] writer [[Rabindranath Tagore]]. India produces the world's largest number of [[Cinema of India|films]] every year. The most recognisable face is that of cinema production based in Mumbai, which produces mainly commercial Hindi films, often referred to as \"[[Bollywood]]\". There are also strong cinema industries based on the [[Kannada language|Kannada]], [[Malayalam]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Telugu language|Telugu]] and [[Bengali cinema|Bengali]] languages.\n[[Image:Kadakali_painting.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Face of a [[Kathakali]] artist, a type of [[Indian classical dance]], from [[Kerala]].]]\n[[Image:Odissi stamp.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Odissi]] dancer wearing [[Sari]].]]\nReligious practices of various faiths are an integral part of everyday life in society. Education is highly regarded by members of every socio-economic stratum. Traditional Indian family values are highly respected, and considered sacred, although urban families have grown to prefer a [[nuclear family]] system, owing to the socio-economic constraints imposed by the traditional [[complex family|joint family]] system. Religion in India is a very public affair, with many practices imbued with pomp and vitality accompanying their underlying spiritual qualities.\n\nThe [[cuisine of India]] is extremely diverse, as ingredients, spices and cooking methods vary from region to region. Rice and wheat are the staple foods in the country. The country is notable for its wide variety of [[vegetarian]] and non-vegetarian [[wikibooks:Cookbook:Cuisine of India|cuisine]]. Spicy food and sweets are popular in India. [[Indian Dress|Traditional dress]] in India greatly varies across the regions in its colours and styles, and depend on various factors, including climate. Popular styles of dress include the traditional [[sari]] for women and the traditional [[dhoti]] for men.\n\nIndia's national sport is [[field hockey]], although [[cricket]] is now the ''de facto'' national game. In some states, particularly in the northeast, [[football (soccer)]] is the most popular sport and is widely watched. In recent times, [[tennis]] has gained popularity in India. [[Chess]] is also gaining popularity with the rise of number of [[grandmasters]]. Traditional indigenous sports include [[kabaddi]]{{inote|http://www.rediff.com/sports/2000/aug/30india.htm|Rediff-1}} and [[gilli-danda]], which are played in most parts of the country.\n\n==Holidays==\n[[Image:DSCF9016.JPG|thumb|150px|[[Holi]], the festival of colours has emerged as one of the most popular Indian festivals.]]\n{{main|List of Festivals in India}}\n\nIndia is also known as a land of festivals. A melting pot of many religions, India has a rich diversity of [[Indian festivals|festivals]], many of which are celebrated irrespective of [[caste]] and creed. The most widely known and popular celebrations include the Hindu festivals of [[Diwali]], [[Holi]], [[Pongal]] and [[Dussehra]] and the Muslim celebration of [[Eid]].\n\nA number of festivals are common to most parts of India; however, they may be called by different names in the various parts of the country or may be celebrated in a different fashion. Every festival is celebrated in a unique style.\n\nIndia has three National Holidays. Other sets of holidays, varying between nine to twelve, pertain to festivals, religious holidays and births of leaders which are legislated by the individual states.\n\n<center>\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"3\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"90%\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse; border:1px solid #aaa; text-align:left\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#efefef;\" width=\"15%\" | Date\n! style=\"background:#efefef;\" width=\"20%\" | Holiday\n! style=\"background:#efefef;\" | Remarks\n|-\n| [[26 January]]\n| [[Republic Day of India|Republic Day]]\n| The Constitution of India came into effect on this day in 1950.\n|-\n| [[15 August]]\n| [[Indian Independence Day|Independence Day]]\n| India gained its independence from the British Empire on this day in 1947.\n|-\n| [[2 October]]\n| [[Gandhi Jayanti]]\n| The Birth Date of [[Mahatma Gandhi]].\n|}\n</center>\n==See also==\n{{Topics related to India}}\n{{India ties}}\n{{Life in India}}\n\n==External links==\n{{portal}}\n{{sisterlinks|India}}\n<!--PLEASE ADD SITES RELATING TO INDIA AS A WHOLE.
