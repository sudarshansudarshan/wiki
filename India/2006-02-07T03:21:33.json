CONSIDER ADDING MATERIAL TO THE 'HISTORY OF INDIA' ARTICLE.-->\n{{main|History of India}}\n[[Stone Age]] rock shelters with paintings at [[Bhimbetka]] in [[Madhya Pradesh]] are the earliest known traces of human life in present-day India. The first known permanent settlements appeared over 9,000 years ago, and gradually developed into the [[Indus Valley Civilisation]], which began around [[3300 BC]] and peaked between [[2600 BC]] and [[1900 BC]]. It was followed by the [[Vedic Civilisation]]. From around [[550 BC]], many independent kingdoms came into being. \n\nIn the north, the [[Mauryan empire|Maurya dynasty]], which included [[Ashoka|A\u015foka The Great]], contributed greatly to India's cultural landscape. From [[180 BC]], a series of invasions from [[Central Asia]] followed. This led to the establishment of the [[Indo-Greek]], [[Indo-Scythian]] and [[Indo-Parthian]] kingdoms in the northern [[Indian Subcontinent]], and finally the [[Kushan Empire]]. From the 3rd century AD, the [[Gupta|Gupta dynasty]] oversaw the period referred to as ancient India's \"Golden Age\". \n\nIn the south, several dynasties, including the [[Chalukyas]], [[Cheras]], [[Cholas]], [[Kadambas]], [[Pallavas]] and [[Pandyas]] prevailed during different periods. [[Ancient Indian science and technology|Science, engineering]], [[Indian art|art]], [[Indian literature|literature]], [[Indian Mathematics|mathematics]], [[Indian science|astronomy]], [[Religion in India|religion]] and [[Indian philosophy|philosophy]] flourished under the patronage of these kings. \n\n[[Image:Sanchi2.jpg|thumb|270px|The [[Sanchi|Sanchi stupa]] in Sanchi, [[Madhya Pradesh]] built by emperor [[Ashoka]] in the 3rd century BC]]\nFollowing the [[Islamic invasion of India|Islamic invasions]] from Central Asia and Persia in the beginning of the second millennium AD, much of north and central India came under the rule of the [[Delhi Sultanate]], and later the [[Mughal empire|Mughal dynasty]], who gradually expanded their reign to much of the Indian subcontinent. Nevertheless, several indigenous kingdoms flourished, especially in the relatively sheltered south, one of which was the [[Vijayanagara Empire]].\n\nDuring mid-second millennium AD, several [[Europe]]an countries, including [[Portugal]], [[Netherlands]], [[France]] and the [[United Kingdom]], who initially wanted to trade with India, took advantage of the fractured kingdoms fighting each other, to establish [[colony|colonies]] in the country. An 1857 insurrection against the [[British East India Company]] failed, known locally as the [[Sepoy Mutiny|First War of Indian Independence]], and in British and some Western literature as the Indian Mutiny, Sepoy Mutiny or Sepoy Rebellion.  After it was put down, much of India came under the direct administrative control of the crown of the [[British Empire]].\n\nIn the early 20th century, the prolonged, non-violent [[Indian independence movement|struggle for independence]] was led by [[Mahatma Gandhi]], widely regarded as the \"Father Of The Nation\". The  struggle culminated on [[1947-08-15]], when India gained full independence from British rule, and became a [[republic]] on [[1950-01-26]].\n\nAs a [[ethnic|multi-ethnic]] and multi-religious nation, India has had some sectarian violence and [[insurgency|insurgencies]] in various parts of the country, but has stayed together as a vibrant [[democracy]]. It has unresolved border disputes with [[People's Republic of China|China]] (which escalated into the brief [[Sino-Indian War]] in 1962), and with [[Pakistan]], which resulted in wars in [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1947|1947]], [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965|1965]], [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971|1971]] and in 1999 in [[Kargil]] (at the northern fringe of [[Jammu and Kashmir]] State).  India is a founding member of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] and the [[United Nations]]. In 1974, India conducted an underground [[Smiling Buddha|nuclear test]], making it an unofficial member of the \"[[nuclear club]]\". This was followed by a series of five more tests in [[Operation Shakti]] in 1998.\n\nSignificant economic reforms beginning in 1991 have transformed India into one of the fastest-growing economies in the world, and added to its global clout.\n\n{{see also|History of South India|Military history of India|Timeline of Indian history}}\n\n==Government==\n{{main|Government of India}}\n\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float: right; margin: 1em; padding: 1em; width: 220px; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%; clear: right\"\n|+ National symbols of India\n|- \n| style=\"padding-left: 1em;\" | '''Flag'''\n| [[Tiranga]]\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left: 1em;\" | '''Emblem'''\n| [[Emblem of India|Sarnath Lion]]\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left: 1em;\" | '''Anthem'''\n| [[Jana Gana Mana]]\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left: 1em;\" | '''Song'''\n| [[Vande Mataram|Vand&#275; M&#257;taram]]\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left: 1em;\" | '''Animal''' \n| [[Bengal Tiger|Royal Bengal Tiger]]\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left: 1em;\" | '''Bird'''\n| [[Indian Peacock]]\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left: 1em;\" | '''Flower'''\n| [[Nelumbo nucifera|Lotus]]\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left: 1em;\" | '''Tree'''\n| [[Banyan]]\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left: 1em;\" | '''Fruit'''\n| [[Mango]]\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left: 1em;\" | '''Sport'''\n| [[Field Hockey]]\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left: 1em;\" | '''Calendar'''\n| [[Indian National Calendar|Saka]]\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left: 1em;\" | '''Costume'''\n| [[Sari]] (women)\n|}\n\nIndia is a [[sovereignty|sovereign]], [[socialist]], [[secular]], [[democratic]] [[republic]]. India has a quasi-federal form of government and a [[bicameral]] [[parliament]] operating under a [[Westminster System|Westminster-style]] parliamentary system. It has a three branches of governance: the [[Legislature]], [[Executive]] and [[Judiciary]].\n\nThe [[President of India|President]] is the [[head of state]], and has a largely ceremonial role, including interpreting the constitution, signing laws into action and issuing pardons. He is also the [[Commander-in-Chief]] of [[Indian military|India's  armed forces]]. The President and the [[Vice-President of India|Vice President]] are elected indirectly by an [[electoral college]] for five-year terms. The [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Minister]] is the [[head of government]], and has most executive powers. He or she is elected by legislators of the political party or [[coalition]] commanding a parliamentary majority, and serves a five-year term, with re-election. The constitution does not explicitly provide for a post of Deputy Prime Minister, but this option has been exercised from time to time.\n\nThe legislature of India is the bicameral [[Indian Parliament|Parliament]], which consists of the upper house called the ''[[Rajya Sabha]]'' (Council of States), and the lower house called the ''[[Lok Sabha]]'' (House of the People). The 245-member ''Rajya Sabha'' is chosen indirectly through an electoral college, and has a staggered six-year term. The 545-member ''Lok Sabha'' is directly elected by popular vote for a five-year term, and is the determinative constituent of political power and government formation. All Indian citizens above age 18 are eligible to vote.\n\nThe executive arm consists of the President, Vice-President and the [[Council of Ministers]] (the [[Cabinet]]), headed by the Prime Minister. Any minister holding a portfolio must be a member of either house of parliament. In the Indian parliamentary system, the executive is subordinate to the legislature.\n\nIndia's independent judiciary consists of the [[Supreme Court of India|Supreme Court]], headed by the [[Chief Justice of India]]. The Supreme Court has both original jurisdiction over disputes between states and the Centre, and appellate jurisdiction over the High Courts of India. There are 18 appellate High Courts, each having jurisdiction over a state or a group of smaller states. Each of these states has a tiered system of lower courts. A conflict between the legislature and the judiciary is referred to the President.\n\n==Politics==\n{{main|Politics of India}}\n[[image:IndiaMap2.PNG|thumb|270px|Map of India.{{mn|LoC|2}}]]\nFor most of its independent history, India has been ruled by the [[Indian National Congress Party]] (INC). Following its position as the largest political organisation in pre-independence India, the INC, usually led by a member of the [[Nehru]]-[[Indira_Gandhi|Gandhi]] family, dominated national politics for over four decades. In 1975, the government led by Indira Gandhi imposed ''[[Indian Emergency|Emergency Rule]]'' across the nation. After emergency was lifted in 1977, and fresh elections were called, a united opposition, under the banner of the [[Janata Party]] won the elections and formed a non-Congress government for a short period. In 1996, the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP), a [[political party]] with a [[Right-wing_politics|right-wing]] nationalist ideology, became the largest single party, and established, for the first time, a serious opposition to the largely centre-left Congress. But power was ''de facto'' held by two successive coalition governments, with the active support of the Congress. In 1998, the BJP formed the [[National Democratic Alliance]] (NDA) along with smaller regional parties, and became the first non-Congress government to sustain a full five-year tenure (1999 to 2004). The decade prior to 1999 was marked by a state of political flux, with seven separate governments formed within that period.\n\nIn the [[Indian general elections, 2004|2004 Indian elections]] the INC returned to power after winning the largest number of seats. It formed a government in alliance with several regional parties, known as the [[United Progressive Alliance]] (UPA), with the outside support of the [[Communist Party of India (Marxist)]] (CPI(M)). The NDA, led by the BJP, currently forms the main opposition. All governments since 1996 have required party coalitions, with no single party claiming a majority, due to the steady rise of regional parties at the national level.\n{{see also|List of recognised political parties in India|Indian election process|Parliament of India|Foreign relations of India}}\n\n==States and union territories==\n{{main|States and territories of India}}\n\nIndia is divided into twenty-eight states (which are further subdivided into [[districts of India|districts]]), six [[union territories|Union Territories]] and the [[national capital territory|National Capital Territory]] of [[Delhi]]. States have their own elected government, whereas Union Territories are governed by an administrator appointed by the Union Government, though some have elected governments.\n\n{{India states}}\nIndia has had two scientific bases in [[Antarctica]] &ndash; the [[Dakshin Gangotri]] and [[Maitri]], but has made no territorial claims so far. \n{{see also|List of states of India by population|List of cities in India}}\n\n==Geography==\n{{main|Geography of India}}\n[[Image:Yumthanghimalayas.jpg|thumb|270px|The [[Himalaya]] stretch from [[Jammu and Kashmir]] in the north to [[Arunachal Pradesh]] in the far east making up most of India's eastern borders]]\n\nIndia's northern and northeastern states are partially situated in the [[Himalaya|Himalayan Mountain Range]]. The rest of northern, central and eastern India consists of the fertile [[Indo-Gangetic plain]]. In the west, bordering southeast [[Pakistan]], lies the [[Thar Desert]]. The southern Indian Peninsula is almost entirely composed of the [[Deccan|Deccan plateau]], which is flanked by two hilly coastal ranges, the [[Western Ghats]] and [[Eastern Ghats]].\n\nIndia is home to several major rivers, including the [[Ganges|Ganga]], [[Brahmaputra]], [[Yamuna]], [[Godavari]], [[Kaveri]], and [[Krishna River|Krishna]]. India has three archipelagos &ndash; [[Lakshadweep]] off the southwest coast, the [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands]] volcanic island chain to the southeast, and the [[Sunderbans]] in the Gangetic Delta in [[West Bengal]] State.\n\nThe Indian [[climate]] varies from [[tropical climate|tropical]] in the south to more [[temperate climate|temperate]] in the north. Parts of India which lie in the Himalayas have a [[tundra]] climate. India gets most of its rains through the [[monsoon]]s.\n\n{{see also|Climate of India|Ecoregions of India|National parks of India|Geology of India}}\n\n==Economy==\n{{main|Economy of India}}\n[[Image:Bombay-Stock-Exchange.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Bombay Stock Exchange]] sensitive index is used as a determinant of the strength of the Indian economy.]]\n[[Image:TbimalRs100mk1.jpg|270px|thumb|right|A hundred-rupee note]]\nIndia's economy ranks tenth in the world in terms of currency conversion (GNP), and fourth in terms of [[Purchasing power parity]] (PPP).
