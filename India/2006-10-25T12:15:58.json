It also has to be submitted to a national referendum no earlier than three months after its approval by the National Assembly.<ref name=\"constitution\">[http://www.asamblea.gob.pa/actualidad/25176_2004.pdf Panamanian Constitution, page 109.] {{es icon}}</ref>\n\n==Proposal==\n{{main|Panama Canal expansion proposal}}\n[[Image:Acpfigure1.jpg|thumb|right|Components of the project]]The [[Panama Canal expansion proposal]] was presented on [[April 24]], [[2006]] by [[Mart\u00edn Torrijos|President Mart\u00edn Torrijos]] to the Panamanian people after years of study by the ACP. The largest project at the Canal since its original construction, the expansion will double its capacity and allow more traffic. \n\nThe project will create a new lane of traffic along the Canal through the construction of a new set of locks.  Details of the project include the following integrated components:\n* The construction of two [[Panama Canal Locks|lock]] complexes, one on the Atlantic side and another on the Pacific side, each with three chambers, which include three water-saving basins; \n* The excavation of new access channels to the new locks and the widening of existing navigational channels; and \n* The deepening of the navigation channels and the elevation of Gat\u00fan Lake's maximum operating level.<ref name=\"proposal\">[http://www.pancanal.com/eng/plan/docs/expansion-proposal.pdf Panama Canal Expansion Proposal by the Panama Canal Authority]</ref>\n\nAccording to the ACP, the project will have an estimated cost of [[USD|US$]]5.25 billion, will be self-financed by tolls increase and will take up to 7 or 8 years of construction time.\n\nPanama's [[Cabinet]] approved the project, and on [[July 14]], the National Assembly unanimously approved the proposal to expand the Canal. In addition, the Assembly created and passed a law mandating a national [[referendum]] in which the people of Panama would vote to approve expansion. The referendum was held on [[October 22]], [[2006]], the first Sunday at least 90 days after the legislation was signed. <ref name=\"washington\">[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/07/16/AR2006071600470.html \"Panama to Vote on Canal Expansion Oct. 22\", ''Washington Post'']</ref>\n\n==Referendum question==\n[[Image:Papeletareferendum2006.jpg|thumb|right|Referendum ballot]]\nThe referendum used a single [[ballot]] divided in half with ''S\u00ed'' (Yes) at the left with a green background and ''No'' at the right with a red background.  Above these two options the text of the question read:\n:''Do you approve the [[Panama Canal expansion proposal|proposal of construction of a Third Set of Locks on the Panama Canal]]?'' <ref name=\"tribunal\">[http://www.tribunal-electoral.gob.pa/referendum/documentos/decreto9.pdf Electoral Tribunal's rules for the referendum] {{es icon}}</ref>.\n\n==Campaign==\nOpposition to the project was vigorous as skeptics questioned the government's cost estimates and raised fears that corruption would doom the project. But the government's campaign for the expansion, the largest modernization of the canal in its history, was even more intense. Officials portrayed a \"s\u00ed\" vote as a vote for the children of Panama. Without an expanded canal, officials predicted, shipping traffic would find other routes and Panama's growing economy would dry up.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/23/world/americas/23panama.html?hp&ex=1161576000&en=90c7dbb05c6766bf&ei=5094&partner=homepage Panamanians Vote to Expand Canal ''The New York Times'']</ref>\n\n==Voting==\n[[Image:laprensareferendum06.jpg|thumb|right|First page of ''La Prensa'' newspaper, [[October 23]], [[2006]].  It reads \"The Canal will expand\".]]\nThe voting process went smoothly, without major events that could tamper the results.  The [[voter turnout]] ended up being very low, with an estimated 60% [[abstention]]. \n\n[[Voting]] took place on schedule from 7 am to 4 pm but people still in line at that time were allowed to vote.<ref name=\"tribunal\"/> Unofficial results were made known by the Electoral Tribunal by its system of unofficial results reporting, just 30 minutes after the voting ended.  This system consists of series of data-collecting centers that communicate with the [[Panama City]] Press Room of the Electoral Tribunal.  This centers receive the unofficial results given by each polling station by phone, cell phone and other means, while the official results begin their journey to the different counting centers.  This system has proved highly successful in previous elections and has given almost the same results as the official count.  Under this system, by 6 p.m. (2 hours after the voting ended) the results of approximately 25% of polling stations were available and the likely approval of the project was known.  However, the official results are the responsibility of the National Scrutiny Junta, and that may take some days as official declarations come from all over the country to [[Panama City]].\n\n==Reactions to the results==\n* [[President]] [[Mart\u00edn Torrijos]] said this was the most important decision this [[generation]] had to take.  He considered the decision an opportunity that has to include all Panamanians, the ones that voted Yes, the ones that voted No, the ones that decided not to vote and the ones too young to vote.<ref>[http://www.presidencia.gob.pa/discurso.php?cod=994 Speech of President Torrijos after the result of the referendum was known.] {{es icon}}</ref>\n* [[Taiwan]] congratulated [[Panama]] on its referendum result and offered to participate in the expansion of the [[Panama Canal]].<ref>[http://www.playfuls.com/news_10_2059-Taiwan-Offers-To-Participate-In-Expansion-Of-Panama-Canal.html Taiwan Offers To Participate In Expansion Of Panama Canal]</ref> \n* The trade organization [[Dansk Rederiforening]] (the Danish Shipping Council) was pleased with the decision to expand the Panama Canal and believe that the expansion will be positive both to the [[Denmark|Danish]] and the international shipping industry.<ref>[http://borsen.dk/650.97215 Danish satisfaction with the Panama expansion]</ref>\n* [[U.S.]] [[Ambassador]] William Eaton said that \"There will be an impact on the pocketbook.

Routing ships to the Gulf would save the West Coast's infrastructure and benefit us as all.

However, the referendum itself will not have an immediate impact on Panama's sovereign ratings, as uncertainties remain about debt financing, future revenues from tolls, and Panama's ongoing fiscal consolidation.<ref>[http://home.businesswire.com/portal/site/google/index.jsp?ndmViewId=news_view&newsId=20061023006088&newsLang=en Fitch: Panama Canal Referendum a Positive Development ]</ref> \n\n==Polls==\n<!--PLEASE  It should always be the date the poll was conducted, not the release date.
