It is home to one of the most [[Indus Valley Civilisation|ancient civilizations]] in recorded history, and a centre of important historic [[Trade route|trade routes]]. Four [[major world religions]] - [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Jainism]] and [[Sikhism]] have Indian origins. India was a part of the [[British Empire]] before gaining [[Indian independence movement|independence]] in 1947. In the last twenty years, the country has grown significantly, especially in the [[Economy of India|economic]] and [[Military of India|military]] spheres.\n\n\n==History==\n<!-- THIS SECTION IS A SUMMARY. CONSIDER ADDING MATERIAL TO THE 'HISTORY OF INDIA' ARTICLE.-->\n{{main|History of India}}\n[[Stone Age]] rock shelters with paintings at [[Bhimbetka]] in [[Madhya Pradesh]] are the earliest known traces of human life in present day India. The first known permanent settlements appeared over 9,000 years ago, and gradually developed into the [[Indus Valley Civilization]], which began from around [[3300 BC]] and peaked between [[2600 BC]] and [[1900 BC]]. It was followed by the [[Vedic Civilization|Vedic Civilisation]]. From around [[550 BC]] onwards, many independent kingdoms came into being. \n\nIn the north, the [[Mauryan empire|Maurya dynasty]], which included [[Ashoka|A\u015foka The Great]], contributed greatly to India's cultural landscape. From [[180 BC]], a series of invasions from [[Central Asia]] followed. This led to the establishment of the [[Kushan Empire]], as well as several [[Indo-Greek]], [[Indo-Scythian]] and [[Indo-Parthian]] kingdoms in quick succession in the northern [[Indian Subcontinent|Indian subcontinent]]. From the 3rd century AD onwards, the [[Gupta|Gupta dynasty]] oversaw the period referred to as ancient India's \"Golden Age\".    \n\nIn the south, several dynasties, including the [[Chalukyas]], [[Cheras]], [[Cholas]], [[Kadambas]], [[Pallavas]] and [[Pandyas]] prevailed during different periods. \n\n[[Ancient Indian science and technology|Science]], [[Indian art|art]], [[Indian literature|literature]], [[Indian Mathematics|mathematics]], [[Indian science|astronomy]], [[Ancient Indian science and technology|engineering]], [[Religion in India|religion]] and [[Indian philosophy|philosophy]] flourished under the patronage of these kings. Following the [[Islamic invasion of India|Islamic invasions]] from Central Asia and Persia in the beginning of the second millennium AD, much of north and central India came under the rule of the [[Delhi Sultanate]], and later the [[Mughal empire|Mughal]] dynasty, who gradually expanded their reign to include much of the Indian subcontinent. Nevertheless, several indigenous kingdoms flourished, especially in the relatively sheltered south. The [[Vijayanagara Empire]] was notable among such kingdoms.\n\nDuring the middle of the second millennium AD, several European countries, including the [[Portugal|Portuguese]], [[Netherland|Dutch]], [[France|French]] and the [[United Kingdom|British]], who were initially interested in trade with India, took advantage of the fractured kingdoms fighting amongst each other, to establish colonies in the country. After a failed insurrection in 1857 against the [[British East India Company]], known locally as the [[Sepoy Mutiny|First War of Indian Independence]] (known variously as the ''Sepoy Mutiny'' or ''Sepoy Rebellion'' in British and some Western literature), much of India came under the direct administrative control of the crown of the [[British Empire]].\n\n[[Image:Abandoned Temple complex at Orcha, Rajastan, India.jpg|thumb|270px|Pictured here is an abandoned [[Hinduism|Hindu]] temple complex in [[Rajastan]], an example of Indian architecture]]\n\nIn the early part of the 20th century, a prolonged non-violent struggle for independence, the [[Indian independence movement]] was led by [[Mahatma Gandhi]], who was widely regarded as the ''Father Of The Nation''. The path-breaking struggle reached its culmination on [[1947-08-15]], when India gained full independence from British rule, later becoming a [[republic]] on [[1950-01-26]].\n\nAs a [[ethnic|multi-ethnic]] and multi-religious nation, India has had its share of sectarian violence and [[insurgency|insurgencies]] in different parts of the country. Nonetheless, it has held itself together as a vibrant [[democracy]]. India has unresolved border disputes with [[People's Republic of China|China]] (which escalated into a brief war in [[Sino-Indian War|1962]]), and [[Pakistan]], which resulted in wars in [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1947|1947]], [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965|1965]], [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971|1971]] and in [[Kargil]] in the northern fringes of [[Jammu and Kashmir|Jammu and Kashmir state]] in [[Kargil|1999]]. India is a founding member of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] and the [[United Nations]]. In 1974, India conducted an underground [[Smiling Buddha|nuclear test]], making it an unofficial member of the \"[[nuclear club]]\". This was followed up with a series of five more tests in [[Operation Shakti|1998]]. Significant economic reforms, beginning in 1991, have transformed India into one of the fastest growing economies in the world, and added to its global clout.\n\n{{see also|History of South India|Military history of India|Timeline of Indian history}}\n\n==Government==\n{{main|Government of India}}\n\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float: right; margin: 1em; padding: 1em; width: 220px; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%; clear: right\"\n|+ National symbols of India\n|- \n| style=\"padding-left: 1em;\" | '''Flag'''\n| [[Tiranga]]\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left: 1em;\" | '''Emblem'''\n| [[Emblem of India|Sarnath Lion]]\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left: 1em;\" | '''Anthem'''\n| [[Jana Gana Mana]]\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left: 1em;\" | '''Song'''\n| [[Vande Mataram|Vand&#275; M&#257;taram]]\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left: 1em;\" | '''Animal''' \n| [[Bengal Tiger|Royal Bengal Tiger]]\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left: 1em;\" | '''Bird'''\n| [[Indian Peafowl]]\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left: 1em;\" | '''Flower'''\n| [[Nelumbo nucifera|Lotus]]\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left: 1em;\" | '''Tree'''\n| [[Banyan]]\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left: 1em;\" | '''Fruit'''\n| [[Mango]]\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left: 1em;\" | '''Sport'''\n| [[Field Hockey]]\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left: 1em;\" | '''Calendar'''\n| [[Indian National Calendar|Saka]]\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left: 1em;\" | '''Costume'''\n| [[Sari]] (women)\n|}\nAccording to the [[Constitution of India]], India shall be a [[sovereignty|Sovereign]], [[Socialist]], [[Secular]], [[Democratic]] [[Republic]]. India is a [[republic]], with a quasi-federal form of Government and a [[bicameral]] [[parliament]] operating under a [[Westminster System|Westminster-style]] parliamentary system. It has a three-branch system of governance consisting of the [[Legislature]], [[Executive]] and [[Judiciary]].\n\nThe [[President of India|President]], who is the [[head of state]], has a largely ceremonial role. His roles include interpreting the constitution, signing laws into action and issuing pardons. He is also the [[Commander-in-Chief]] of India's [[Indian military|armed forces]]. The President and the [[Vice-President of India|Vice President]] are elected indirectly by an [[Electoral college|electoral college]] for five-year terms. The [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Minister]] is the [[head of government]], and most executive powers are vested in this office. He (or she) is elected by legislators of the political party or [[coalition]] commanding a parliamentary majority, and serves a five-year term, incumbent upon enjoying this majority. The constitution does not explicitly provide for a post of Deputy Prime Minister, but this option has been exercised from time to time.\n\nThe legislature of India is the bicameral [[Indian Parliament|Parliament]], which consists of the upper house known as the ''[[Rajya Sabha]]'' (Council of States), and the lower house known as the ''[[Lok Sabha]]'' (House of the People). The 245 member ''Rajya Sabha'' is chosen indirectly through an electoral college, and has a staggered six year term. The 545 member ''Lok Sabha'' is directly elected by a popular vote for a five year term, and is the determinative constituent of political power and government formation. All Indian citizens above the age of eighteen are eligible to vote.\n\nThe executive arm consists of the President, Vice-President and the [[Council of Ministers]] (the [[Cabinet]]), headed by the Prime Minister. Any minister holding a portfolio must be a member of either house of parliament. In India's parliamentary system, the executive is subordinate to the legislature.\n\nIndia's independent judiciary consists of the [[Supreme Court of India|Supreme Court]], headed by the [[Chief Justice of India]]. The Supreme Court has both original jurisdiction over disputes between states and the Centre, and appellate jurisdiction over the High Courts of India. There are eighteen appellate High Courts, having jurisdiction over a large state, or a group of smaller states. Each of these states has a tiered system of lower courts. A conflict between the legislature and the judiciary is referred to the President.\n\n==Politics==\n{{main|Politics of India}}\n[[image:IndiaMap2.PNG|thumb|270px|Map of India.{{mn|LoC|2}}]]\nFor most of its independent history, India has been ruled by the [[Indian National Congress Party]] (INC). Following its position as the largest political organisation in pre-independence India, the INC, usually led by a member of the [[Nehru]]-[[Indira_Gandhi|Gandhi]] family, dominated national politics for over four decades. In 1975, the government led by Indira Gandhi imposed ''Emergency Rule'' across the nation. After emergency was lifted in 1977, and fresh elections were called, a united opposition, under the banner of the [[Janata Party]] won the elections and formed a non-Congress government for a short period of time. In 1996, the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP), a [[political party]] with a [[Right-wing_politics|right wing]] nationalist ideology, became the largest single party, and established, for the first time, a serious opposition to the largely centre-left Congress. But power was ''de facto'' held by two successive coalition governments, with the active support of the Congress. In 1998, the BJP formed the [[National Democratic Alliance]] (NDA) along with smaller regional parties, and became the first non-Congress government to sustain a full five year tenure (1999&ndash;2004). The decade prior to 1999 was marked by a state of political flux, with seven separate governments formed within that period.\n\nIn the [[Indian general elections, 2004|2004 Indian elections]] the INC returned to power after winning the largest number of seats. The Congress Party formed a government in alliance with several regional parties, known as the [[United Progressive Alliance]] (UPA), with the outside support of the [[Communist Party of India (Marxist)]] (CPI(M)). The NDA, led by the BJP, currently forms the main opposition. All governments formed since 1996 have required party coalitions, with no single party claiming a majority, due to the steady rise of regional parties at the national level.\n{{see also|List of recognised political parties in India|Indian election process|Parliament of India|Foreign relations of India}}\n\n==States and union territories==\n{{main|States and territories of India}}\n\nIndia is divided into twenty-eight states (which are further subdivided into [[districts of India|districts]]), six [[union territories|Union Territories]] and the [[national capital territory|National Capital Territory]] of [[Delhi]]. States have their own elected government, whereas Union Territories are governed by an administrator appointed by the Union Government, though some have elected governments.\n\n{{India states}}\nIndia has had two scientific bases in [[Antarctica]] &ndash; the [[Dakshin Gangotri]] and [[Maitri]], but has made no territorial claims so far. \n{{see also|List of states of India by population|List of cities in India}}\n\n==Geography==\n{{main|Geography of India}}\n[[Image:Yumthanghimalayas.jpg|thumb|270px|The [[Himalaya]] stretch from [[Jammu and Kashmir]] in the north to [[Arunachal Pradesh]] in the far east making up most of India's eastern borders]]\n\nIndia's northern and northeastern states are partially situated in the [[Himalaya|Himalayan Range]]. The rest of northern, central and eastern India consists of the fertile [[Indo-Gangetic plain]]. Towards western India, bordering southeast [[Pakistan]], lies the [[Thar Desert]]. The southern Indian peninsula is almost entirely composed of the [[Deccan|Deccan plateau]]. The plateau is flanked by two hilly coastal ranges, the [[Western Ghats]] and [[Eastern Ghats]].\n\nIndia is home to several major rivers, including the [[Ganges|Ganga]], [[Brahmaputra]], [[Yamuna]], [[Godavari]], [[Kaveri]], and [[Krishna River|Krishna]]. India has three archipelagos &ndash; [[Lakshadweep]], off the south west coast of India, a volcanic island chain called the [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands]] to the south east, and the [[Sunderbans]] in the Gangetic Delta in the state of [[West Bengal]].\n\nThe Indian [[climate]] varies from [[tropical climate|tropical]] in the south to more [[temperate climate|temperate]] in the north. Parts of India which lie in the Himalayas have a [[tundra]] climate. India gets most of its rains through the [[monsoon]]s.\n\n{{see also|Climate of India|Ecoregions of India|National parks of India|Geology of India}}\n\n==Economy==\n{{main|Economy of India}}\n[[Image:Bombay-Stock-Exchange.jpg|thumb|270px|The Bombay Stock Exchange sensitive index is used as a determinant of the strength of the Indian economy.]]\n\nIndia has an economy ranked tenth in the world in terms of currency conversion (GNP), and fourth largest in terms of [[Purchasing power parity|PPP]]. It recorded one of the fastest growth rate (8.1%) for the fourth quarter of 2005.  India's per-capita income (by purchasing power parity) is [[USD |US$]] 3,200, [[List of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita|ranked 125th]] according to the [[World Bank]]. India's [[foreign exchange]] reserves amount to over US$ 145 billion.{{inote|see ecotimes|i-2}} [[Mumbai]] is the nation's financial capital, and is also home to the headquarters of both the [[Reserve Bank of India]] and the pre-eminent [[Bombay Stock Exchange]]. While a quarter of Indians still live below the [[poverty line]], a large [[middle class]] has now emerged along with the rapid growth of the [[information technology|IT]] and service industries.\n\nThe Indian economy has shed much of its historical dependence on [[agriculture]], which now contributes about 21% to the GDP.{{inote|see Indian economy|i-3}} Other important industries are [[mining]], [[petroleum]], [[diamond]] polishing, [[film industry|films]], [[textile]]s, [[information technology|IT]] and [[business process outsourcing]] (BPO) services, [[pharmaceuticals]] and [[chemicals]] and [[handicrafts]]. Most of India's industrial regions are centred around major cities. In recent years, India has emerged as one of the largest players in the software and [[business process outsourcing|BPO]] service industries, with revenues of US$ 17.2 billion in 2004 to 2005.{{inote|software}} Many small-scale industries provide steady employment to workers in small towns and villages.\n\n[[Image:TbimalRs100mk1.jpg|270px|thumb|A hundred-rupee note]]\nWhile India receives only around three million foreign visitors a year, tourism is still an important but under-developed source of national income. Tourism contributes 5.3% of India's GDP. The actual employment generation, both direct and indirect, is estimated to be 42 million, or about 10% of India's work force. In monetary terms, it contributes about US$4 billion in foreign exchange.{{inote|tourism}} India's major trading partners are the [[United States]], [[Japan]], [[People's Republic of China|China]] and the [[United Arab Emirates]].{{inote|trade}}\n\nIndia's main exports include agricultural products, textile goods, gems and jewelry, software services, engineering goods, chemicals and leather products, while its main imports are crude oil, machinery, gems, fertiliser, and chemicals. For the year 2004, India's total exports stood at US$ 69.18 billion, while the imports were worth at US $89.33 billion.{{inote|figure}}\n\n{{see also|List of Indian companies}}\n\n==Demographics== \n{{main|Demographics of India}}\nIndia is the second most populous country in the world, with only China having a larger population. By 2030, India is expected to surpass China as the world's most populous nation, estimated at 1.6 billion. Language, religion, and [[caste]] are major determinants of social and political organisation within the highly diverse Indian population today. Its biggest [[metropolitan]] agglomerations are [[Mumbai]] (formerly ''Bombay''), [[Delhi]], [[Kolkata]] (formerly ''Calcutta'') and [[Chennai]] (formerly ''Madras'').\n[[Image:Temple complex at Orcha, Rajastan, India.jpg|thumb|270px|[[Hinduism]] is the largest professed creed in India.\n\nIndia's [[literacy|literacy rate]] is 64.8%, with 53.7% of females and 75.3% of males being literate. The sex ratio is 933 females for every 1000 males.{{inote|literacy}} [[Work Participation Rate]] (WPR) (the percentage of workers to total population) stands at 39.1%, with male WPR at 51.7% and female WPR at 25.6% {{inote|eu}} India's median age is 24.66, and has a growth rate of 22.32 births per 1,000.{{inote|demostats}}\n\nAlthough 80.5% of the people are [[Hinduism|Hindus]], India is also home to the [[Islam by country|third largest]] population of [[Muslim]]s in the world (13.4% see [[Islam in India]]), after [[Indonesia]] and [[Pakistan]]. Other smaller religious minorities include [[Christianity|Christians]] (2.3%), [[Sikhism|Sikhs]] (1.84%), [[Buddhism|Buddhists]] (0.76%), [[Jainism|Jains]] (0.40%), [[Jew]]s, [[Zoroastrians]], [[Ahmadi]]s, and [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith|Bah\u00e1'\u00ed]]s.{{inote|religion}}\n\nIndia is home to two major [[Languages of India|linguistic families]], the [[Indo-Aryan]] (spoken by about 74% of the Indian population) and [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]] (spoken by about 24% of the Indian population). Other languages spoken in India come from the [[Austro-Asiatic]] and [[Tibeto-Burman]] linguistic families.  The Indian constitution recognises 23 official languages{{ref|languages}}. [[Hindi]], along with [[English language|English]] are the languages used by the [[Government of India|Central Government]] for official purposes. Two [[classical languages]] native to the land are [[Sanskrit]] and [[Tamil language|Tamil]]. The number of [[Indian languages|mother tongues]] in India is as high as 1,652.{{inote|tongues}}\n{{see also|List of Indian languages by total speakers|Religion in India|Indian Caste System}}\n\n==Culture==\n{{main|Culture of India}}\n[[Image:Taj Mahal in March 2004.jpg|thumb|270px|right|The [[Taj Mahal]] in [[Agra]] is India's most popular tourist destination.]]\n\nIndia has a rich and unique cultural heritage, and has managed to preserve its established traditions throughout history. It has always absorbed customs, traditions and ideas from both invaders and immigrants. Many cultural practices, languages, customs and even monuments are examples of this co-mingling over centuries. Famous monuments, such as the [[Taj Mahal]] and other examples of Islamic-inspired architecture have been inherited from the Mughal dynasty. These are the result of a syncretic tradition that combined elements from all parts of the country.\n\nIndian society is largely pluralist, multilingual and [[multicultural]]. Religious practices of various faiths are an integral part of everyday life in society. Education is highly regarded by members of every socio-economic stratum. Traditional Indian family values are highly respected, and considered sacred, although urban families have grown to prefer a [[nuclear family]] system, owing to the socio-economic constraints imposed by the traditional [[complex family|joint family]] system.\n[[Image:gumpa.jpg|thumb|270px|The Gumpa dance is a mystic dance celebrated by the [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhist]] community in [[Sikkim]] during the Buddhist New Year &mdash; [[Losar]]]]\n\nReligion in India is a very public affair, with many practices imbued with pomp and vitality accompanying their underlying spiritual qualities. A melting pot of many religions, India has a rich diversity of [[Indian festivals|festivals]], many of which are celebrated by all, irrespective of caste and creed. The most widely known and popular celebrations include the Hindu festivals of [[Diwali]], [[Holi]], and [[Dussehra]]. [[Pongal]] in [[Tamil Nadu]] and [[Onam]] in [[Kerala]] are harvest festivals celebrated by people belonging to all religions in their respective states. ''Durga Puja'' in West Bengal, and ''Ganesh Chaturthi'' in Maharastra and Karnataka (both during autumn) are two magnificent festivals, from a religious, social and cultural point of view.\n\n[[Music of India|Indian music]] is represented by a wide variety of forms. The two main forms of [[Indian classical music|classical music]] are ''[[Carnatic music|Carnatic]]'' from  [[Karnataka]], [[South India]], and ''[[Hindustani classical music|Hindustani]]'' from [[North India]]. Popular forms of music also prevail, the most notable being [[Filmi music]]. In addition to this are the diverse traditions of [[Indian folk music|folk music]] from different parts of the country. Many [[Indian classical dance|classical dance forms]] exist in India, including the [[Bharatanatyam]], [[Odissi]], [[Kathakali]], [[Kuchipudi]], [[Kathak]], [[Manipuri]], [[Mohiniyattam]], [[Yakshagana]]. They often have a narrative form (based on the [[itihasa|Indian epics]]), and are usually infused with devotional and spiritual elements.\n\nThe earliest [[Indian literature|literary traditions]] in India were mostly oral, and were later transcribed. Most of these spring from Indian (later called [[Hindu]]) traditions, and are represented by sacred works like the [[Vedas]] and the epics of the [[Mahabharatha]] and [[Ramayana]]. [[Sangam]] literature from [[Tamil Nadu]] represents some of India's oldest traditions. There have been many notable Indian writers in modern times, both in Indian languages [[Indian Writing in English|and in English]]. India's only [[Nobel Prize for Literature|Nobel laureate in literature]] was the [[Bengali language|Bengali]] writer [[Rabindranath Tagore]].\n\nIndia produces the world's largest number of [[Cinema of India|movies]] every year. The most recognisable face is that of cinema production based in [[Mumbai]], which produces mainly commercial [[Hindi]] films, often referred to as \"[[Bollywood]]\". Cinema in other vernacular languages is also particularly strong, with movies regularly produced in well-established [[Kannada language|Kannada]], [[Malayalam]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]] and [[Telugu language|Telugu]] industries. India's contribution to world cinema was the internationally renowned [[Bengali language|Bengali]] director [[Satyajit Ray]], who in [[1992]] won an [[Academy_Honorary_Award|Academy Award for Lifetime Achievement]].\n\n[[Rice]] and [[wheat]] (in bread form) are the staple foods in the country. The [[cuisine of India]] is extremely diverse, as ingredients, spices and cooking methods vary from region to region. The country is notable for its wide variety of [[vegetarian]] and non vegetarian [[wikibooks:Cookbook:Cuisine of India|cuisine]]. Spicy food and sweets are popular in India. [[Indian Dress|Traditional dress]] in India greatly varies across the regions in its colours and styles, and depend on various factors, including climate. The traditional [[sari]] and the [[salwar kameez]] are popular styles of dress for women. Traditional raiments for men are the [[kurta]] and [[dhoti]].\n{{see also|List of World Heritage sites in India|Indian architecture|Indian family name|Cuisine of India}}\n\n==Sports and games==\n{{main|Sports in India}}\nIndia's national sport is [[field hockey]], although [[cricket]] is now the ''de facto'' national game due to its success and popularity in recent times. Though cricket's popularity is widespread, it is not the most popular sport in quite a few Indian states, particularly in India's northeast. Another international sport in which India has a fair degree of parity with other nations is [[chess]], in which Indian [[Viswanathan Anand]] has been [[FIDE]] World Champion, and several players have made significant inroads in recent years, well past the [[International Grandmaster|Grandmaster]] level. India also has a tradition of cue sports ([[snooker]], [[billiards]], etc) and shooting.\n\nIndia has had relatively little success in other international events like the [[Olympics]], where it garnered a total of just one silver medal and two bronze medals in the previous three outings. However, it has won eight [[field hockey]] golds up until 1980. India has done rather well in [[Davis Cup]] [[tennis]] tournaments, having reached the finals on three occasions. Its players have secured several individual titles and [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] doubles wins, but an Indian is yet to win a Grand Slam singles title.\n\nSome traditional indigenous sports are [[polo]], [[kabaddi]], [[Kho Kho]] and [[gilli-danda]], which are played in most parts of the country. [[Chess]], [[badminton]] and [[carrom]] are some other games and sports that are said to have originated in India. [[Snooker]] and [[badminton]] have seen Indians achieve some international success. [[Football (soccer)]] also finds a large viewership in almost the entire country, and is the most popular sport in many states of India. [[Formula 1]] is also increasing in popularity, due to racing driver [[Narain Karthikeyan]], though its reach is largely limited to urban areas.\n\n==Holidays==\n{{further|[[List of Festivals in India]]}}\n\nIndia has three National Holidays. Other sets of holidays, varying between nine to twelve, pertains to festivals, religious holidays and births of leaders which are legislated by the individual states.\n{{Official Holidays of India}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Topics related to India}}\n\n==External links==\n{{portal}}\n{{sisterlinks|India}}\n\n<!--PLEASE ADD SITES RELATING TO INDIA AS A WHOLE.

This state borders a part of [[Afghanistan]]. A ceasefire sponsored by the [[United Nations]] in 1948 freezes the positions of Indian and Pakistani held territory. As a consequence, the region bordering Afghanistan is in Pakistani-administered territory.\n*{{mnb|LoC|2}} The black line is the boundary as recognised by the government of India. The northern region of [[Kashmir]] is currently administered by India, Pakistan, and China (and coloured in as such). The delimiting of the three administered regions is ''not'' the international boundary but a ceasefire line demarcated in red. The boundary separating India and Pakistan is known as the [[Line of Control]], that separating India and China as the '[[Line of Actual Control]]'. Most of the state of [[Arunachal Pradesh]] has been formerly claimed by China.\n\n----\n* '''India''' is also the letter '''[[I]]''' in the [[NATO phonetic alphabet]].\n\n{{India ties}}\n{{Life in India}}\n\n[[Category:India|*]]\n[[Category:Republics]]\n[[Category:Members of the Commonwealth of Nations]]\n[[Category:SAARC members]]\n\n{{Link FA|sv}}\n\n{{Link FA|sv}}\n\n[[af:Indi\u00eb]]\n[[als:Indien]]\n[[ang:India]]\n[[ar:\u0647\u0646\u062f]]\n[[an:India]]\n[[as:\u09ad\u09be\u09b0\u09a4]]\n[[ast:India]]\n[[ay:India]]\n[[bg:\u0418\u043d\u0434\u0438\u044f]]\n[[zh-min-nan:\u00ccn-t\u014d\u00b7]]\n[[be:\u0406\u043d\u0434\u044b\u044f]]\n[[bn:\u09ad\u09be\u09b0\u09a4]]\n[[bh:\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924]]\n[[bs:Indija]]\n[[br:India]]\n[[ca:\u00cdndia]]\n[[cv:\u0418\u043d\u0434\u0438]]\n[[chr:India]]\n[[co:India]]\n[[cs:Indie]]\n[[cy:India]]\n[[da:Indien]]\n[[de:Indien]]\n[[et:India]]\n[[el:\u0399\u03bd\u03b4\u03af\u03b1]]\n[[es:India]]\n[[eo:Barato]]\n[[eu:India]]\n[[fa:\u0647\u0646\u062f]]\n[[fo:India]]\n[[fr:Inde]]\n[[fy:Yndia]]\n[[fur:Indie]]\n[[ga:An India]]\n[[gd:Na h-Innseachan]]\n[[gl:India - \u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924]]\n[[got:\ud800\udf39\ud800\udf3d\ud800\udf33\ud800\udf39\ud800\udf30]]\n[[gn:India]]\n[[gu:\u0aad\u0abe\u0ab0\u0aa4]]\n[[ko:\uc778\ub514\uc544]]\n[[ht:End]]\n[[haw:\u02bbInia]]\n[[hy:\u0540\u0576\u0564\u056f\u0561\u057d\u057f\u0561\u0576]]\n[[hi:\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924]]\n[[hr:Indija]]\n[[io:India]]\n[[id:India]]\n[[ia:India]]\n[[iu:\u1403\u14d0\u144e\u140a]]\n[[is:Indland]]\n[[it:India]]\n[[he:\u05d4\u05d5\u05d3\u05d5]]\n[[jv:India]]\n[[kn:\u0cad\u0cbe\u0cb0\u0ca4]]\n[[ka:\u10d8\u10dc\u10d3\u10dd\u10d4\u10d7\u10d8]]\n[[kk:\u04ae\u043d\u0434\u0456\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d]]\n[[csb:Indie]]\n[[ks:\u06c1\u0650\u0646\u062f\u0648\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646]]\n[[kw:Eynda]]\n[[km:\u17a5\u178e\u17d2\u178c\u17b6]]\n[[sw:Uhindi]]\n[[ku:Hindistan]]\n[[la:India]]\n[[lv:Indija]]\n[[lt:Indija]]\n[[lb:Indien]]\n[[li:India]]\n[[jbo:barat]]\n[[hu:India]]\n[[mk:\u0418\u043d\u0434\u0438\u0458\u0430]]\n[[ml:\u0d07\u0d28\u0d4d\u0d24\u0d4d\u0d2f]]\n[[mt:Indja]]\n[[mi:Inia (whenua)]]\n[[mr:\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924]]\n[[ms:India]]\n[[nah:India]]\n[[na:India]]\n[[nl:India]]\n[[cr:India]]\n[[ne:\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924]]\n[[nds:Indien]]\n[[ja:\u30a4\u30f3\u30c9]]\n[[nap:Innia]]\n[[no:India]]\n[[nn:India]]\n[[oc:\u00cdndia]]\n[[or:\u0b2d\u0b3e\u0b30\u0b24]]\n[[os:\u0418\u043d\u0434\u0438]]\n[[ps:\u0647\u0646\u062f]]\n[[pl:Indie]]\n[[pt:\u00cdndia]]\n[[pa:\u0a2d\u0a3e\u0a30\u0a24]]\n[[ro:India]]\n[[rm:India]]\n[[qu:Indiya]]\n[[ru:\u0418\u043d\u0434\u0438\u044f]]\n[[se:India]]\n[[sa:\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924]]\n[[sc:\u00ccndia]]\n[[sq:India]]\n[[sh:Indija]]\n[[scn:India]]\n[[simple:India]]\n[[sd:\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924]]\n[[sk:India]]\n[[sl:Indija]]\n[[sr:\u0418\u043d\u0434\u0438\u0458\u0430]]\n[[su:India]]\n[[fi:Intia]]\n[[sv:Indien]]\n[[tl:Indya]]\n[[tg:\u04b2\u0438\u043d\u0434\u0443\u0441\u0442\u043e\u043d]]\n[[ta:\u0b87\u0ba8\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0bbf\u0baf\u0bbe]]\n[[tt:Hindstan]]\n[[te:\u0c2d\u0c3e\u0c30\u0c24 \u0c26\u0c47\u0c36\u0c2e\u0c41]]\n[[th:\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e30\u0e40\u0e17\u0e28\u0e2d\u0e34\u0e19\u0e40\u0e14\u0e35\u0e22]]\n[[vi:\u1ea4n \u0110\u1ed9]]\n[[tpi:India]]\n[[tr:Hindistan]]\n[[uk:\u0406\u043d\u0434\u0456\u044f]]\n[[ur:\u0628\u06be\u0627\u0631\u062a]]\n[[uz:Hindiston]]\n[[wa:Inde]]\n[[yi:\u05d0\u05d9\u05e0\u05d3\u05d9\u05b4\u05d9\u05e2]]\n[[yo:India]]\n[[zh:\u5370\u5ea6]]"
