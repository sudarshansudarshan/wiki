[[Chandigarh Capital Region]] including [[Mohali]], [[Panchkula]] and [[Zirakpur]] had a combined population of 1,165,111 (1.16 million) as per the 2001 census.\n\nKnown internationally for its architecture and urban planning, it is the first planned city of [[India]].<ref name=\"ci2\">[http://business.gov.in/investment_incentives/chandigarh.php Business Portal of India]</ref> Chandigarh is home to numerous architectural projects of [[Le Corbusier]], [[Pierre Jeanneret]], Matthew Nowicki, and Albert Mayer. The city tops the list of [[Indian States]] and [[Union Territories]] with the highest per capita income in the country at Rs.99,262 at current prices and Rs.70,361 at constant prices (2006\u20132007).<ref>[http://www.thehindu.com/2008/09/17/stories/2008091755600800.htm]</ref>\n\n== History ==\nAfter the [[Partition of India|partition of British India]] into the two nations of India and Pakistan in 1947, the region of Punjab was also split between [[India]] and [[Pakistan]]. The Indian state of Punjab required a new capital city to replace [[Lahore]], which became part of [[Pakistan]] during the partition. After several plans to make additions to existing cities were found to be infeasible for various reasons, the decision to construct a new and planned city was undertaken.\n\nOf all the [[new town]] schemes in independent [[India]], the Chandigarh project quickly assumed prime significance, because of the city's strategic location as well as the personal interest of [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], the first [[Prime Minister]] of independent India. Commissioned by [[Nehru]] to reflect the new nation's modern, progressive outlook, [[Nehru]] famously proclaimed Chandigarh to be \"unfettered by the traditions of the past, a symbol of the nation's faith in the future.\" Several buildings and layouts in Chandigarh were designed by the [[French people|French]] (born [[Swiss]]) architect and urban planner, [[Le Corbusier]], in the 1950s. Le Corbusier was in fact the second architect of the city, after the initial master plan was prepared by the [[United States|American]] architect-planner Albert Mayer who was working with the [[Poland]]-born [[architect]] Matthew Nowicki. It was only after Nowicki's death in 1950 that [[Le Corbusier]] was pulled into the project.\n\nOn 1 November 1966, the newly-formed Indian state of [[Haryana]] was carved out of the eastern portion of the Punjab, in order to create [[Haryana]] as a majority [[Hindi]] speaking state, while the western portion of Punjab retained a mostly [[Punjabi language]]-speaking majority and remained as the current day Punjab. However, the city of Chandigarh was on the border, and was thus created into a [[union territory]] to serve as capital of both these states. It was the capital of Punjab alone from 1952 to 1966.<ref>http://chandigarh.gov.in/admn_index.htm</ref> Chandigarh was due to be transferred to Punjab in 1986, in accordance with an agreement signed in August 1985 by [[Rajiv Gandhi]], the then [[Prime Minister]] of India, with Sant Harchand Singh Longowal of the [[Akali Dal]]. This was to be accompanied by the creation of a new capital for [[Haryana]], but the transfer had been delayed. There is currently a discussion about which villages in southern districts of Punjab should be transferred to [[Haryana]], and about which [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]]-speaking villages should be transferred to Punjab. But analysts believe that now it is not possible as none of the State governments would like to give up their claim and Chandigarh would remain to be the capital of both states and a union territory.\n\nOn 15 July 2007, Chandigarh became the first Indian city to go smoke-free. Smoking at public places was strictly prohibited and considered as a punishable act by Chandigarh Administration but, according to public opinion and a secret survey done by several prominent citizens of the U.T., smoking still exists in Chandigarh, which is not completely smoke-free zone due to delays in the construction of smoking zones promised to by the administration. Recent developments also showed that Chandigarh had became the hub of drugs and a very spoiled part of northern India. The police are recognised as the most effective police in the region, mostly free from corruption with high-spirited officers first taking the cause to make Chandigarh drug-free, but they failed to do so. The roots of drugs lie deep and the area is becoming degraded as modernisation, the term used to cover the decaying values and manners for which the area was once famous. That was followed up by a complete ban on polythene bags with effect from 2 October 2008, the birthday of [[Mahatma Gandhi]]<ref>http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Cities/Chandigarh/Smoke_out_smoking_violations_/articleshow/3551323.cms</ref><ref>http://chandigarh.nic.in/WriteReadData%5Cnotification%5Cnot_env684_300708.pdf</ref>.\n\n== Geography and Climate==\n[[Image:Chandigarh Lake.jpg|left|thumb|Sukhna Lake]]\n[[Image:Morni hills.jpg|thumb|right|Morni Hills]]\nChandigarh is located near the foothills of the [[Shivaliks|Shivalik]] range of the [[Himalaya]]s in Northwest [[India]]. It covers an area of approximately 44 [[square mile|sq&nbsp;mi]] or 114&nbsp;km\u00b2. and shares its borders with the states of [[Haryana]] in the east and Punjab in the north, west and south. The exact cartographic co-ordinates of Chandigarh are {{Coord|30.74|N|76.79|E|}}.<ref>[http://www.fallingrain.com/world/IN/5/Chandigarh.html Falling Rain Genomics, Inc - Chandigarh]</ref> It has an average elevation of 321 metres (1053&nbsp;ft).\n\n{{climate chart\n|Chandigarh\n|6.1|20.4|33\n|8.3|23.1|39\n|13.4|28.4|30\n|18.9|34.5|9\n|23.1|38.3|28\n|25.4|38.6|145\n|23.9|34.0|280\n|23.3|32.7|308\n|21.8|33.1|133\n|17.0|31.8|22\n|10.5|27.3|9\n|6.7|22.1|22\n|source=[http://www.worldweather.org/066/c00526.htm World Weather Information Service]\n|float=right\n|clear=\n}}\n\nThe surrounding districts are of [[Mohali]], [[Patiala]] and [[Roopnagar]] in Punjab and [[Panchkula]] and [[Ambala]] in Haryana. The boundary of the state of [[Himachal Pradesh]] is also minutes away from its north border. Chandigarh has a sub-tropical continental monsoon climate characterized by a seasonal rhythm: hot summers, slightly cold winters, unreliable rainfall and great variation in temperature (-1 \u00b0C to 41.2 \u00b0C). In winter, frost sometimes occurs during December and January. The average annual rainfall is [http://chandigarh.nic.in/knowchd_general.htm 1110.7 mm]. The city also receives occasional winter rains from the west.\n\n''' Average temperature'''\n\n* '''Spring''': The climate remains quite pleasant during the spring season (from mid-February to mid-March and then from mid-September to mid-October). Temperatures vary between (max) 16 \u00b0C to 25 \u00b0C and (min) 9 \u00b0C to 18 \u00b0C.\n* '''Autumn''': In autumn (from Mid-March to April), the temperature may rise to a maximum of 36 \u00b0C. Temperatures usually remain between 16\u00b0 to 27\u00b0 in autumn. The minimum temperature is around 13 \u00b0C.\n* '''Summer''': The temperature in summer (from Mid-May to Mid-June) may rise to a maximum of 46.5 \u00b0C (rarely). Temperatures generally remain between 35 \u00b0C to 40 \u00b0C.\n* '''Monsoon''': During monsoon(from mid-June to mid-September), Chandigarh receives moderate to heavy rainfall and sometimes heavy to very heavy rainfall (generally during the month of August or September). Usually, the rain bearing monsoon winds blow from south-west/ south-east. Mostly, the city receives heavy rain from south (which is mainly a persistent rain) but it generally receives most of its rain during monsoon either from North-west or North-east. Maximum amount of rain received by the city of Chandigrah during monsoon season is 195.5&nbsp;mm in a single day.\n* '''Winter''': Winters (November to Mid-March) are quite cool and it can sometimes get quite chilly in Chandigarh. Average temperatures in the winter remain at (max) 7 \u00b0C to 15 \u00b0C and (min) -2 \u00b0C to 5 \u00b0C. Rain usually comes from the west during winters and it is usually a persistent rain for 2\u20133 days with sometimes hail-storms.\n\n==Flora and fauna==\n[[Image:sambar-deer-in-forest.jpg|200px|thumb|Sambar in a forest]]\n[[Image:Cassia.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Cassia Fistulia in Chandigarh]]\nMost of Chandigarh is covered by dense [[Banyan]] and [[Eucalyptus]] plantations. [[Ashoka tree|Asoka]], [[Cassia Fistula|Cassia]], [[Mulberry]] and other trees flourish in the forested ecosystem.The city has forests surrounding it which sustain many animal and plant species. [[Deer]]s, [[Sambar]]s, [[Barking Deer]]s, [[Parrot]]s, [[Woodpecker]]s and [[Peacock]]s inhabit the protected forests. [[Sukhna Lake]] hosts a variety of ducks and geese, and attracts migratory birds from parts of Siberia and Japan in the winter season.\n\nA parrot sanctuary located in the city is home to a variety of bird species.\n\n== Architecture and urban planning ==\nTaking over from Albert Mayer, Le Corbusier produced a plan for Chandigarh that conformed to the modern city planning principles of [[Congr\u00e8s International d'Architecture Moderne]] CIAM, in terms of division of urban functions, an anthropomorphic plan form, and a hierarchy of road and pedestrian networks.\nThis vision of Chandigarh, contained in the innumerable conceptual maps on the drawing board together with notes and sketches had to be translated into brick and mortar. Le Corbusier retained many of the seminal ideas of Mayer and Nowicki, like the basic framework of the master plan and its components: The Capitol, City Center, besides the University, Industrial area, and linear parkland. Even the neighborhood unit was retained as the basic module of planning. However, the curving outline of Mayer and Nowicki was reorganized into a mesh of rectangles, and the buildings were characterized by an \"honesty of materials\". Exposed brick and boulder stone masonry in its rough form produced unfinished concrete surfaces, in geometrical structures. This became the architectural form characteristic of Chandigarh, set amidst landscaped gardens and parks.\n\n[[image:Chandigarh Monument.jpg|thumb|The Open Hand Monument]]\n\nThe initial plan had two phases: the first for a population of 150,000 and the second taking the total population to 500,000. Le Corbusier divided the city into units called \"sectors\", each representing a theoretically self-sufficient entity with space for living, working and leisure. The sectors were linked to each other by a road and path network developed along the line of the 7 Vs, or a hierarchy of seven types of circulation patterns. At the highest point in this network was the V1, the highways connecting the city to others, and at the lowest were the V7s, the streets leading to individual houses. Later a V8 was added: cycle and pedestrian paths.\nThe Palace Assembly, designed by Le Corbusier\nThe city plan is laid down in a grid pattern. The whole city has been divided into rectangular patterns, forming identical looking sectors, each sector measures 800 m x 1200 m. The sectors were to act as self-sufficient neighbourhoods, each with its own market, places of worship, schools and colleges - all within 10 minutes walking distance from within the sector. The original two phases of the plan delineated sectors from 1 to 47, with the exception of 13 (Number 13 is considered unlucky). The Assembly, the secretariat and the high court, all located in Sector - 1 are the three monumental buildings designed by Le Corbusier in which he showcased his architectural genius to the maximum. The city was to be surrounded by a 16 kilometer wide greenbelt that was to ensure that no development could take place in the immediate vicinity of the town, thus checking suburbs and urban sprawl; hence is famous for its greenness too.\n\nWhile leaving the bulk of the city's architecture to other members of his team, Le Corbusier took responsibility for the overall master plan of the city, and the design of some of the major public buildings including the High Court, Assembly, Secretariat, the Museum and Art Gallery, School of Art and the Lake Club. Le Corbusier's most prominent building, the Court House, consists of the High court, which is literally higher than the other, eight lower courts. Most of the other housing was done by Le Corbusier's cousin [[Pierre Jeanneret]], the English husband and wife team of [[Maxwell Fry]] and [[Jane Drew]], along with a team of nine Indian architects.\nThe city in its final form, while not resembling his previous city projects like the Ville Contemporaine or the Ville Radieuse, was an important and iconic landmark in the history of town planning. It continues to be an object of interest for architects, planners, historians and social scientists. Chandigarh has two satellite cities: [[Panchkula]] and [[Mohali]]. Sometimes, the triangle of these three cities is collectively called the Chandigarh Tricity.\n\n== Chandigarh UT Administration ==\nChandigarh Administration is under the control of the Administrator who is appointed under the provisions of Art 239 of the Constitution. The administrative control of Chandigarh is under the Ministry of Home Affairs. The ''Adviser to the Administrator'', a very senior officer equevalent to the ''Chief Secretary'' of a state, belonging to one of the [[All India Services]], is second in command after the Administrator. He generally belongs to the AGMU cadre of the Indian Administrative Service.\n[[image:Corbu Chandigarh Palais Justice.JPG|thumb|Chandigarh High Court]]\n\n* The [[Deputy Commissioner (India)|Deputy Commissioner]], an officer belonging to the [[Indian Administrative Service]], is the in-charge of the General Administration in the Chandigarh UT.\n* The [[Superintendent of Police (India)|Senior Superintendent of Police]], an officer belonging to the [[Indian Police Service]], is responsible for maintaining Law & Order and related issues in the Chandigarh UT.\n* The [[Deputy Conservator of Forests (India)|Deputy Conservator of Forests]], an officer belonging to the [[Indian Forest Service]], is responsible for the management of the Forests, Environment, Wild-Life and Pollution Control in the Chandigarh UT.\n\nThe above three officers are generally from AGMU cadre and can also be from Punjab or Haryana cadres of the [[All India Services]].\n\n==Demographics==\n{{IndiaCensusPop\n| title= Chandigarh Population\n| 1961= 119881\n| 1971= 257251\n| 1981= 451610\n| 1991= 642015\n| 2001= 900635\n| estimate=\n| estyear=\n| estref=\n| footnote= source:Census of India <ref name=\"Census population\">{{cite web|url=http://sampark.chd.nic.in/images/State_2006/StatisticalAbstract2004/Areapopulation/area_pop_tab2.1.pdf|title=Census population|work=Census of India|publisher=http://sampark.chd.nic.in|accessdate=2008-06-04|format=PDF}}</ref>\n}}\n{{As of|2001}} India [[census]],<ref>{{GR|India}}</ref> Chandigarh had a population of 900,635, making for a density of about 7900 persons per square kilometre.

Chandigarh has an average literacy rate of 81.9%, higher than the national average of 64.8%; with male literacy of 86.1% and female literacy of 76.5%. About 12% of the population is under 6 years of age. The main religions in Chandigarh are [[Hinduism]](78.60%), [[Sikhism]] (16.1%), [[Islam]] (3.9%), and [[Christianity]] (0.8%).<ref>[http://censusindia.gov.in/Dist_File/datasheet-0401.pdf Indian Census]</ref> [[Hindi language|Hindi]] and [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] and are the main languages spoken in Chandigarh, although these days [[English language|English]] is quite popular. \nA significant percentage of the population of Chandigarh consists of people who had moved here from the neighboring states of [[Haryana]] and [[Punjab (India)|Punjab]] to fill up the large number of vacancies in various government departments that were established in Chandigarh.\n\n== Economy ==\n[[File:IT-Park-at-Chandigarh.Jpg|thumb|A Shopping mall in the city.]]\nThe government is a major employer in Chandigarh with three governments having their base here. A significant percentage of Chandigarh\u2019s population therefore consists of people who are either working for one of these governments or have retired from government service. For this reason, Chandigarh is often called a \u201cPensioner's Paradise\u201d. There are about 15 medium to large industrial including two in the Public sector. In addition Chandigarh has over 2500 units are registered under small scale sector. The important industries are paper manufacturing, basic metals and alloys and machinery.

The city also boasts of a well established network of modern radio cabs .\n\nChandigarh is well connected by road. The two main National Highways (NH) connecting Chandigarh with the rest of the country are: NH 22 (Ambala - Kalka - Shimla - Kinnaur) and NH 21 (Chandigarh - Leh). Chandigarh has two Inter-State Bus Terminus (ISBT), one for the North, East and South located in Sector 17, which is the biggest depot of [[Haryana Roadways]] and has regular bus services to most major cites in [[Haryana]],and the national capital [[Delhi]], which is about 240&nbsp;km away. And a second in Sector 43 for the Western section, [[Punjab (India)|Punjab]], [[Himachal Pradesh]], and [[Uttarakhand]]and Jammu and Kashmir.\n\nChandigarh has a railway station located about 10&nbsp;km. away from the ISBT.
