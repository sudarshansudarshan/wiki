However, administratively, the city is not under the jurisdiction of either state, it is administered by the [[Government of India| Central government]] and hence classified as a [[union territory]]. The Governor of the Punjab is the Administrator of Chandigarh.\n\nThe city derives its name from a temple of goddess ''Chandi'' (the Chandi Mandir) located in nearby [[Panchkula District]] of Haryana. The word Chandigarh literally means \"the fort of Chandi\".\n\nChandigarh is known for its high standard of living with highest per capita income in the country and tops the list of [[Indian States]] and [[Union Territories]] with a [[Human Development Index]] of 0.674. <ref name=\"Tribune\">[http://www.tribuneindia.com/2002/20020428/cth1.htm The Tribune]</ref>\n\nChandigarh has two [[satellite]] cities (both of which share a border with it): [[Panchkula]] and [[Mohali]]. Sometimes, the triangle of these three cities is collectively called as the [[Chandigarh Tricity]].\n\n==Brief history==\n[[Image:Rockgarden.jpg|right|thumb|The Rock Garden, Chandigarh. One of many scenic spots in Chandigarh]]\nAfter the [[Partition of India|partition]] of [[British India]] into the two nations of [[India]] and [[Pakistan]] in 1947, the region of Punjab was also split between India and Pakistan. The Indian state of Punjab required a new capital city to replace [[Lahore]], which became part of Pakistan during the partition.  After several plans to make additions to existing cities were found to be infeasible for various reasons, the decision to construct a new and planned city was undertaken.  \n\nOf all the new town schemes in independent India, the Chandigarh project quickly assumed prime significance, because of the city's strategic location as well as [[Jawaharlal Nehru|Jawaharlal Nehru's]] (the first Prime Minister of independent India) personal interest in it. Commissioned by Nehru to reflect the new nation's modern, progressive outlook, Nehru famously proclaimed Chandigarh to be \"unfettered by the traditions of the past, a symbol of the nation's faith in the future.\" Several buildings and layouts in Chandigarh were designed by the [[Swiss]]-born [[France|French]] [[architect]] and [[urban planning|planner]], [[Le Corbusier]] in the 1950s. Le Corbusier was in fact the second architect of the city, after the initial master plan was prepared by the [[United States|American]] architect-planner [[Albert Mayer]] who was working with the [[Poland|Polish]]-born architect [[Matthew Nowicki]]. It was only after Nowicki's untimely death in 1950 that Le Corbusier was pulled into the project.\n\nOn [[1 November]], [[1966]], the newly-formed Indian state of [[Haryana]] was carved out of the eastern portion of the Punjab, in order to create Haryana as a majority [[Hindi]] speaking state, while the western portion of Punjab retained a mostly [[Punjabi]]-speaking majority and remained as the current day [[Punjab (India)|Punjab]]. However, the city of Chandigarh was on the border, and was thus created into a [[union territory]] to serve as capital of both these states. Chandigarh was due to be transferred to Punjab in 1986, in accordance with an agreement signed in August 1985 by [[Rajiv Gandhi]], the Prime Minister of India at that time, with Sant Harchand Singh Longowal of the [[Akali Dal]]. This was to be accompanied by the creation of a new capital for Haryana, but the transfer has been delayed pending an agreement on the districts of Punjab that should be transferred to Haryana in exchange.\n\nOn [[15 july]] [[2007]],[[Chandigarh]] became the first Indian city to go smoke free.\n\nThe other planned cities in India: [[Edwin Lutyens|Lutyens]]'s [[New Delhi]], [[Bhubaneshwar]] in [[Orissa]], [[Gandhinagar]] in [[Gujrat]] and [[Navi Mumbai]] in [[Maharashtra]], were built close to existing old cities ([[Delhi]], [[Cuttack]], [[Ahmedabad]] and [[Mumbai]] respectively).\n\n==Geography==\nChandigarh is located near the foothills of the [[Shivaliks|Shivalik]] range of the [[Himalaya]]s in Northwest India. It covers an area of approximately 114 km\u00b2. and  shares its borders with the states of Haryana in the south and Punjab in the north. The exact cartographic co-ordinates of Chandigarh are {{coor d|30.74|N|76.79|E|}}.<ref>[http://www.fallingrain.com/world/IN/5/Chandigarh.html Falling Rain Genomics, Inc - Chandigarh]</ref> It has an average elevation of 321&nbsp;[[metre]]s (1053&nbsp;[[foot (unit of length)|feet]]).\nThe surrounding districts are of Mohali and Ropar in Punjab and Panchkula in Haryana. The boundary of the state of Himachal Pradesh are not too far from its north.\n\n==Climate==\nChandigarh has a sub-tropical continental monsoon climate characterized by a seasonal rhythm: hot summers, slightly cold winters, unreliable rainfall and great variation in temperature (0 \u00b0C to 46.5 \u00b0C). In winter, frost sometimes occurs during December and January. The average annual rainfall is recorded at [http://www.rainwaterharvesting.org/Urban/Rainfall.htm 617 mm]. The city also receives occasional winter rains from the west.\n\n''' Average temperature''' \n* '''Summer''': The temperature in summer may rise to a maximum of 46.5\u00b0C. Temperatures generally remain between 35&deg;C to 42&deg;C.\n* '''Autumn''': In autumn, the temperature may rise to a maximum of 36&deg;C. Temperatures usually remain between 16\u00b0 to 27\u00b0 in autumn. The minimum temperature is around 13&deg;C.\n* '''Winter''': Winters are quite cool and it can sometimes get quite chilly in Chandigarh. Average temperatures in winter (November to February) remain at (max) 7&deg;C to 20 &deg;C and (min) 0&deg;C to 5&deg;C. \n* '''Spring''': The climate remains quite pleasant during the spring season. Temperatures vary between (max) 16&deg;C to 25&deg;C and (min) 9&deg;C to 18&deg;C.\n\n==Plan and architecture==\n\nTaking over from Albert Mayer, [[Le Corbusier]] produced a plan for Chandigarh that conformed to the [[modernism|modernist]] city planning principles of [[Congr\u00e8s International d'Architecture Moderne|CIAM]], in terms of division of urban functions, an [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] plan form, and a hierarchy of road and pedestrian networks. \n\nThis vision of Chandigarh, contained in the innumerable conceptual maps on the drawing board together with notes and sketches had to be translated into brick and mortar. Le Corbusier retained many of the seminal ideas of Mayer and Nowicki, like the basic framework of the master plan and its components: the Capitol, City Centre, besides the University, Industrial area, and linear parkland. Even the neighbourhood unit was retained as the basic module of planning. However, the curving outline of Mayer and Nowicki was reorganised into a mesh of rectangles, and the buildings were characterised by an 'honesty of materials'. Exposed brick and boulder stone masonry in its rough form produced unfinished concrete surfaces, in geometrical structures. This became the architecture form characteristic of Chandigarh, set amidst landscaped gardens and parks.\n[[Image:Chandigarhroundabout.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Chandigarh is regarded as one of the most beautiful cities in India. [[Roundabout]]s like this one can be found throughout the city.]]\nThe initial plan had two phases: the first for a population of 150,000 and the second taking the total population to 500,000.  Le Corbusier divided the city into units called 'sectors', each representing a theoretically self-sufficient entity with space for living, working and leisure.  The sectors were linked to each other by a road and path network developed along the line of the 7 Vs, or a hierarchy of seven types of circulation patterns.  At the highest point in this network was the V1, the highways connecting the city to others, and at the lowest were the V7s, the streets leading to individual houses.  Later a V8 was added: cycle and pedestrian paths.  \n\nThe city plan is laid down in a [[grid pattern]]. The whole city has been divided into rectangular patterns, forming identical looking sectors, each sector measures 800 m x 1200 m. The sectors were to act as self-sufficient neighbourhoods, each with its own market, places of worship, schools and colleges - all within 10 minutes walking distance from within the sector. The original two phases of the plan delineated sectors from 1 to 47, with the exception of 13.The Assembly, the secretariat and the high court, all located in Sector - 1 are the three monumental buildings designed by Le Corbusier in which he showcased his architectural genius to the maximum. The city was to be surrounded by a 16 kilometre wide [[greenbelt]] that was to ensure that no development could take place in the immediate vicinity of the town, thus checking suburbs and urban sprawl.  \n\nWhile leaving the bulk of the city's architecture to other members of his team, Le Corbusier took responsibility for the overall master plan of the city, and the design of some of the major public buildings including the High Court, Assembly, Secretariat, the Museum and Art Gallery, School of Art and the Lake Club.  Le Corbusier's most prominent building, the Court House, consists of the High court, which is literally higher than the other, eight lower courts. Most of the other housing was done by Le Corbusier's cousin [[Pierre Jeanneret]], the English husband and wife team of [[Maxwell Fry]] and [[Jane Drew]], along with a team of nine Indian architects -- M. N. Sharma, A. Ar. Prabhawalkar, B. P. Mathur, Piloo Moody, U. E. Chowdhury, N. S. Lamba, J. L. Malhotra, J. S. Dethe and [[Aditya Prakash]].\n\nThe city in its final form, while not resembling his previous city projects like the [[Ville Contemporaine]] or the [[Ville Radieuse]], was an important and iconic landmark in the history of town planning. It continues to be an object of interest for architects, planners, historians and social scientists.\n\n==Demographics==\n[[Image:Chandigarhround.jpg|right|thumb|Flower show in Chandigarh]]\n[[As of 2001]] India [[census]],<ref>{{GR|India}}</ref> Chandigarh had a population of 900,635, making for a density of about 7900 persons per square kilometre. Males constitute 56% of the population and females 44%. The sex ratio is 777 females for every 1,000 males \u2013 which is the lowest in the country. Chandigarh has an average literacy rate of 73%, higher than the national average of 59.5%; with male literacy of 76% and female literacy of 68%. About 12% of the population is under 6 years of age. The main religions in Chandigarh are [[Hinduism]] (78.6%), [[Sikhism]] (16.1%), [[Islam]] (3.9%), and [[Christianity]] (0.8%) <ref>http://www.censusindia.net/religiondata/ 2001 Indian Census Data</ref>. [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] and [[Hindi]] are the main languages spoken in Chandigarh, but [[English language|English]] is also quite prevalent. A small number of people also speak [[Urdu language|Urdu]]. However, the most common language for informal communication, especially among the youth of the city is a combination of Hindi and English, commonly referred to as [[Hinglish]]. \n\nA significant percentage of the population of Chandigarh consists of people who had moved here from the neighbouring states of Punjab, Haryana and Himachal Pradesh to fill up the large number of vacancies in various government departments that were established in Chandigarh.\n\n== Economy ==\n=== Government ===\nThe government is a major employer in Chandigarh with three governments having their base here.  A significant percentage of Chandigarh\u2019s population therefore consists of people who are either working for one of these governments or have retired from government service.  For this reason, Chandigarh is often called a \u201cPensioner's Paradise\u201d.\n\n=== Industry ===\nThere are about 15 medium to large industrial including two in the Public sector.  In addition Chandigarh has over 2500 units are registered under small scale sector.  The important industries are paper manufacturing, basic metals and alloys and machinery. Other industries are relating to food products, sanitary ware, auto parts, machine tools, pharmaceuticals and electrical appliances.  Yet, with a [[Per Capita Income]] of Rs. 67,370, Chandigarh is the [http://www.ibnlive.com/news/chandigarhs-the-richest-of-em-all/12571-3.html richest] city in India. Chandigarh's gross state domestic product for 2004 is estimated at $2.2 billion in current prices.\n\n=== Banking ===\nChandigarh has a well developed market and banking infrastructure.  Nearly all the major banks in the country have registered their presence in Chandigarh. Most banks with a pan India presence have their zonal/regional offices present in Chandigarh.  In fact Bank square in [[Sector 17]] in chandigarh has a large presence of such offices all in one section of the commercial sector.\n\n===Chambers of commerce===\nThree major trade promotion organizations have their offices in Chandigarh. These are: Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce & Industry, (FICCI) the PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( PHDCCI) and the [[Confederation of Indian Industry]] (CII) which has its regional headquarters at Sector 31, Chandigarh. \n\nThis is a '''[http://www.nse-india.com/content/indices/ind_cnx500list.htm list] of top NSE-indexed conglomerates with corporate offices in Chandigarh'''.

This includes a large number two wheelers such as [[mo-bykes(termed as motor-bykes or motor-cycles also)]]s and [[Scooter (motorcycle)|scooters]]. Chandigarh also has the [http://www.deccanherald.com/deccanherald/jun132006/national181232006612.asp largest] number of vehicles per capita. Wide, well maintained roads and ample parking space all over the city, make it convenient to use private vehicles for local transport.\n\nPublic buses run by the [[Chandigarh Transport Undertaking]] (CTU), an undertaking of the Chandigarh Administration, provide local transport as well as inter-state transport services.\n\nThe Chandigarh Traffic Police oversees the implementation of the traffic rules, and is widely credited for a fairly orderly traffic system. The Traffic Park in Sector 23 introduces children, rickshaw-pullers and new drivers to traffic safety.\n\nRickshaws are common for travelling short distances, especially by school-going children, housewives and the elderly. Autorickshaws are limited, and most often ply to and from the ISBT. Most heavy traffic roads now have rickshaw lanes, which the rickshaw-pullers must adhere to compulsorily.\n\nChandigarh is well connected by road. The two main National Highways (NH) connecting Chandigarh with the rest of the country are: NH 22 (Ambala - Kalka - Shimla - Kinnaur) and NH 21 (Chandigarh - Leh). Chandigarh has two Inter-State Bus Terminus (ISBT), one for the North, East and South located in Sector 17, which has regular bus services to most major cites in  Haryana, [[Himachal Pradesh]],  and [[Uttarakhand]], as well as the national capital [[Delhi]], which is about 240 km away. And a second in Sector 43 for the Western section, mainly Punjab, some parts of Himachal and Jammu and Kashmir.\n\nChandigarh has a small railway station located about 10 km. away from the ISBT.  Regular train connections are available to the national capital [[New Delhi]] and to some other junctions like [[Kalka]], [[Ambala]], [[Amritsar]], [[Bhiwani]], [[Howrah]], [[Mumbai]], [[Chennai]], [[Trivandrum]] and [[Sri Ganganagar]].  Chandigarh also has a domestic airport located nearly 12 kilometers from the ISBT.  Its name is Chandigarh Airport. [[Jet Airways]], [[Air Deccan]] and [[Indian (airline)]] operate regular flights from Chandigarh to New Delhi and [[Mumbai]].\n\nIn the near future, the city will also see, a Metro Rail, and an international airport.
