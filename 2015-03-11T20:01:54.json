The average annual rainfall is [http://chandigarh.nic.in/knowchd_general.htm 1110.7 mm]. The city also receives occasional winter rains from the [[Western Disturbance]] originating over the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. Cold winds usually tend to come from the north near [[Shimla]], capital of Himanchal Pradesh and from the state of [[Jammu and Kashmir]], both of which receive their share of snowfall during wintertime.\n\nThe city experiences the following seasons and the respective average temperatures:\n\n*'''Spring''': The climate remains the most enjoyable part of the year during the spring season (from February-end to early-April). Temperatures vary between (max) 13&nbsp;\u00b0C to 20&nbsp;\u00b0C and (min) 5&nbsp;\u00b0C to 12&nbsp;\u00b0C.\n*'''Autumn''': In autumn (from September-end to mid November.), the temperature may rise to a maximum of 30&nbsp;\u00b0C. Temperatures usually remain between 10\u00b0 to 22\u00b0 in autumn. The minimum temperature is around 6&nbsp;\u00b0C.\n*'''Summer''': The temperature in summer (from Mid-April to June-end) may rise to 44&nbsp;\u00b0C. The temperatures might sometime rise to 44&nbsp;\u00b0C in mid-June. Temperatures generally vary between 40 to 42&nbsp;\u00b0C. \n*'''Monsoon''': During monsoon (from early-July to mid-September), Chandigarh receives moderate to heavy rainfall and sometimes heavy to very heavy rainfall (generally during the month of August or September). Usually, the rain bearing monsoon winds blow from south-west/south-east. Mostly, the city receives heavy rain from south (which is mainly a persistent rain) but it generally receives most of its rain during monsoon either from North-west or North-east. Maximum amount of rain received by the city of Chandigarh during monsoon season is 195.5&nbsp;mm in a single day.\n*'''Winter''': Winters (November-end to February-end) are mild but it can sometimes get quite chilly in Chandigarh. Average temperatures in the winter remain at (max) 5&nbsp;\u00b0C to 14&nbsp;\u00b0C and (min) -1&nbsp;\u00b0C to 5&nbsp;\u00b0C. Rain usually comes from the west during winters and it is usually a persistent rain for 2\u20133&nbsp;days with sometimes hailstorms.
