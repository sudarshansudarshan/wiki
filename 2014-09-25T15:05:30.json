As a union territory, the city is ruled directly by the [[Government of India|Union Government of India]] and is not part of either state. The city of Chandigarh was the first [[planned city]] in India post-independence in 1947 and was known internationally for its architecture and urban design.<ref name=\"ci2\">[http://business.gov.in/investment_incentives/chandigarh.php Business Portal of India]</ref> The master plan of the city was prepared by [[Le Corbusier]], transformed from an earlier plan by the American planner Albert Mayer.

The boundary of the state of [[Himachal Pradesh]] is also minutes away from its north border.\n\nChandigarh has a [[humid subtropical climate]] characterised by a seasonal rhythm: very hot summers, mild winters, unreliable rainfall and great variation in temperature (\u22121&nbsp;\u00b0C to 46&nbsp;\u00b0C). The average annual rainfall is [http://chandigarh.nic.in/knowchd_general.htm 1110.7 mm]. The city also receives occasional winter rains from the [[Western Disturbance]] originating over the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. Cold winds usually tend to come from the north near [[Shimla]], capital of Himanchal Pradesh and from the state of [[Jammu and Kashmir]], both of which receive their share of snowfall during wintertime.\n\n===Average temperature===\n\n*'''Spring''': The climate remains the most enjoyable part of the year during the spring season (from February-end to early-April). Temperatures vary between (max) 13&nbsp;\u00b0C to 20&nbsp;\u00b0C and (min) 5&nbsp;\u00b0C to 12&nbsp;\u00b0C.\n*'''Autumn''': In autumn (from September-end to mid November.), the temperature may rise to a maximum of 30&nbsp;\u00b0C. Temperatures usually remain between 10\u00b0 to 22\u00b0 in autumn. The minimum temperature is around 6&nbsp;\u00b0C.\n*'''Summer''': The temperature in summer (from Mid-April to June-end) may rise to a maximum of 44nbsp;\u00b0C. Temperatures generally remain between 30&nbsp;\u00b0C to 42&nbsp;\u00b0C .\n*'''Monsoon''': During monsoon (from early-July to mid-September), Chandigarh receives moderate to heavy rainfall and sometimes heavy to very heavy rainfall (generally during the month of August or September). Usually, the rain bearing monsoon winds blow from south-west/south-east. Mostly, the city receives heavy rain from south (which is mainly a persistent rain) but it generally receives most of its rain during monsoon either from North-west or North-east. Maximum amount of rain received by the city of Chandigrah during monsoon season is 195.5&nbsp;mm in a single day.\n*'''Winter''': Winters (November-end to February-end) are mild but it can sometimes get quite chilly in Chandigarh. Average temperatures in the winter remain at (max) 5&nbsp;\u00b0C to 14&nbsp;\u00b0C and (min) -1&nbsp;\u00b0C to 5&nbsp;\u00b0C. Rain usually comes from the west during winters and it is usually a persistent rain for 2\u20133&nbsp;days with sometimes hail-storms.The city witnessed bone-numbing chill as the maximum temperature on Monday, 7 January 2013 plunged to a 30-year low to settle at 6.1 degrees Celsius.\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Chandigarh\n|metric first = Yes\n|single line = Yes\n|temperature colour = pastel\n|Jan high C = 19.4\n|Feb high C = 21.1\n|Mar high C = 29.5\n|Apr high C = 34.5\n|May high C = 42.4\n|Jun high C = 44.3\n|Jul high C = 35.0\n|Aug high C = 32.8\n|Sep high C = 29.1\n|Oct high C = 28.8\n|Nov high C = 19.9\n|Dec high C = 18.1\n\n|Jan low C = 3.9\n|Feb low C = 5.4\n|Mar low C = 10.4\n|Apr low C = 14.9\n|May low C = 28.2\n|Jun low C = 30.9\n|Jul low C = 24.0\n|Aug low C = 22.3\n|Sep low C = 20.8\n|Oct low C = 16.0\n|Nov low C = 9.5\n|Dec low C = 4.7\n\n| Jan rain mm  = 46.6\n| Feb rain mm  = 33.9\n| Mar rain mm  = 29.3\n| Apr rain mm  = 11.3\n| May rain mm  = 24.2\n| Jun rain mm  = 112.6\n| Jul rain mm  = 276.3\n| Aug rain mm  = 282.8\n| Sep rain mm  = 179.0\n| Oct rain mm  = 41.6\n| Nov rain mm  = 6.7\n| Dec rain mm  = 18.9\n| year rain mm = \n|Jan rain days= 3.8\n|Feb rain days= 3.9\n|Mar rain days= 2.6\n|Apr rain days= 2.4\n|May rain days= 2.5\n|Jun rain days= 7.1\n|Jul rain days= 12.9\n|Aug rain days= 13.3\n|Sep rain days= 6.1\n|Oct rain days= 1.9\n|Nov rain days= 1.3\n|Dec rain days= 1.9\n|source 1= World Meteorological Organisation<ref name=\"WMO\">[http://worldweather.wmo.int/066/c00526.htm World Weather Information Service-Chandigarh], World Meteorological Organisation.

[[Ashoka tree|Ashoka]], [[Cassia Fistula|cassia]], [[mulberry]] and other trees flourish in the forested ecosystem. The city has forests surrounding that sustain many animal and plant species. [[Deer]], [[Sambar (deer)|sambar]]s, [[barking deer]], parrots, [[woodpecker]]s and [[peacock]]s inhabit the protected forests. [[Sukhna Lake]] hosts a variety of ducks and geese, and attracts migratory birds from parts of Siberia and Japan in the winter season.\n\nA parrot sanctuary in the city is home to a variety of bird species. It has popular gardens, e.g. [[Zakir Hussain Rose Garden]], [[Rock Garden of Chandigarh|Rock Garden]], Terrace Garden, Bougainvillea Garden, Shanti Kunj and many others.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{IndiaCensusPop\n| title= Chandigarh Population\n| 1961= 119881\n| 1971= 257251\n| 1981= 451610\n| 1991= 642015\n| 2001= 900635\n| estimate=\n| estyear=\n| estref=\n| footnote= source:Census of India<ref name=\"Census population\">{{cite web|url=http://sampark.chd.nic.in/images/State_2006/StatisticalAbstract2004/Areapopulation/area_pop_tab2.1.pdf|title=Census population|work=Census of India|publisher=http://sampark.chd.nic.in|accessdate=2008-06-04|format=PDF}}</ref>\n}}\n{{As of|2011}} India census, Chandigarh had a population of 960,787 with metro population of 1,025,682,<ref name=Cities1Lakhandabove /> making for a density of about 9258 (7900 in 2001) persons per square kilometre.<ref>http://www.censusindia.gov.in/</ref><ref name=\"Census observations\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ssachd.nic.in/disereport.htm|title=Census observations|work=Census of India|publisher=http://www.ssachd.nic.in}}</ref> Males constitute 55% of the population and females 45%.

A significant percentage of Chandigarh\u2019s population therefore consists of people who are either working for one of these governments or have retired from government service. For this reason, Chandigarh is often called a \u201cPensioner's Paradise\u201d. Ordnance Cable Factory of the [[Ordnance Factories Board]] has been set up by the [[Government of India]]. There are about 15 medium to large industries including two in the Public sector. In addition Chandigarh has over 2500 units registered under small-scale sector. The important industries are paper manufacturing, basic metals and alloys and machinery. Other industries are relating to food products, sanitary ware, auto parts, machine tools, pharmaceuticals and electrical appliances. Yet, with a per capita income of [[Image:Indian Rupee symbol.svg|8px]] 99,262, Chandigarh is the richest city in India.<ref>[http://www.ibnlive.com/news/chandigarhs-the-richest-of-em-all/12571-3.html Chandigarh's the richest of 'em all<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Chandigarh's gross state domestic product for 2004 is estimated at $2.2&nbsp;billion in current prices.\n\nThree major trade promotion organisations have their offices in Chandigarh.

Chandigarh's infrastructure, proximity to [[Delhi]], Haryana, Punjab and [[Himachal Pradesh]], and the IT talent pool attracts IT businesses looking for office space in the area. Major Indian firms and multinational corporations like [[Quark, Inc.|Quark]], [[Infosys]], [[Dell, Inc.|Dell]], [[IBM, Inc.|IBM]], [[TechMahindra]], have set up base in the city and its suburbs.
