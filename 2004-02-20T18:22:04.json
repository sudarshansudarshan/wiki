However, the city does not belong to either state. Rather, the city is administered by the federal government and hence classified as a [[union territory]]. '''Chandigarh''' is also the name of this union territory.\r\n\r\nChandigarh was a [[planned city]] until 1983, like [[Gandhinagar]], the capital of [[Gujarat]], until 1972.\r\n\r\nSeveral buildings in Chandigarh were designed by the Swiss [[architect]] [[Le Corbusier]] in the [[1950s]].\r\n\r\n==External links==\r\n*http://chandigarh.nic.in/\r\n*http://www.pals.org/pec/chandigarh/chandigarh.html\r\n\r\n{{msg:India}}\r\n\r\n{{msg:stub}}"
