The selection of the physical site involved an extensive vetting process. Many existing towns in Punjab were surveyed as options for the new capital and dismissed for poor performance concerning factors such as military defensibility and capacity for accommodating potential refugee influxes. The construction of a new town in Chandigarh was determined to be the best option due to its relative strength in these factors as well as its proximity to the national capital, New Delhi, its central location within the state of Punjab, its abundance of fecund land and its beautiful natural landscape.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://chandigarh.gov.in/knowchd_gen_historical.htm |title=Historical Background |work=Government of Chandigarh |access-date=7 April 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519173408/http://http/ |archive-date=19 May 2011 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Chandigarh Architecture Museum, Sector 10-C.jpg|thumb|Architecture Museum in Sector 10, Chandigarh chronicles the architectural development of Chandigarh]]\n\n===Modernism in new town design===\nOff the back of this conflation of assets Chandigarh then was well poised to serve a function as a city-building project in national identity.

Chandigarh was for Nehru and Le Corbusier an embodiment of the egalitarian potential offered by [[modernism]], where the machine age would complete the liberation of the nation's citizens through the productive capacity of industrial technology and the relative ease of constructing civic facilities such as dams, hospitals, and schools; the very antithesis of the conservative and traditional legacy of colonialism.<ref name=\"National Identity\"/> Though built as a state capital Chandigarh came to be focused on industry and higher education.<ref name=\"Indian new towns\"/> The specialisation of these new towns in particular functions represents a crucial aspect of the modernisation process as a decolonising enterprise, in completing a national portfolio where each town forms a part of the utopian model for contemporary India.\n\nThe post-colonialism of Chandigarh is rooted in the transformation of the political ideas of those such as Nehru who generated a new Indian nationalism through the design of newly built forms.<ref name=\"postcolonial\">{{cite journal |last1=Shaw|first1=Annapurna|s2cid=145266110|title=Town Planning in Postcolonial India, 1947\u20131965: Chandigarh Re-Examined|journal=Urban Geography|volume=30|issue=8|pages=864\u2013873|doi=10.2747/0272-3638.30.8.857|year=2009}}</ref> Scholars such as [[Edward Said]] have emphasised the sinister nature of nostalgia and the romanticisation of colonial architecture in newly independent colonies as artefacts that perpetuate the ideological legacy of the hegemony and replicate the hierarchy of power even after decolonisation.<ref name=\"decolonisation\">{{cite journal|last1=James-Chakraborty|first1=Kathleen|title=Beyond postcolonialism: New directions for the history of nonwestern architecture|journal=Frontiers of Architectural Research|volume=3|issue=1|pages=2|doi=10.1016/j.foar.2013.10.001|year=2014|doi-access=free}}</ref> Insofar as modernism in architecture (which defined town planning under the Nehru era of rule) represents an active radical break from tradition and a colonial past even the very presence of Le Corbusier has been recognised as an indelible resistance to the British construction legacy, as he provided the first non-British influence on design thinking in India, enabling a generational shift in the contemporary cohort of architects and planners to be hired by the state throughout the rest of the century who were initiated under Modernist conditioning.<ref name=\"postcolonial\"/>\n\nAs early as the 1950s the presence of the [[International Style (architecture)|International Style]] could be detected in the design of houses in India, \"whether [[mistri]] or architect-designed\".<ref name=\"independent architecture\">{{cite book |last1=Lang|first1=Jon|last2=Desai|first2=Madhavi|last3=Desai|first3=Miki|date=1997|title=Architecture and Independence: The Search for Identity\u2014India 1880 to 1980|location=New York, NY|publisher=Oxford University Press, USA|page=213|isbn=978-0-195-63900-1}}</ref> The development of low-cost housing was a priority for Chandigarh, and the modern forms designed by Corbusier are characterised by a dispensing with colonial forms focused on classic aesthetics and a refocusing on strategies such as using narrow frontages and orientation for minimising direct exposure to the sun and maximising natural ventilation and efficient cost while providing modern amenities in the International Style aesthetic.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Jackson|first1=Iain|s2cid=143917493|title=Maxwell Fry and Jane Drew's early housing and neighborhood planning in Sector-22, Chandigarh|journal=Planning Perspectives|volume=28|issue=1|pages=12|doi=10.1080/02665433.2013.734993|year=2013}}</ref> These developments are credited as the beginning of a \"Chandigarh architecture\", inspiring gradual experimentation with form and an \"Indianising\" of the International Style which precipitated the formation of the country's new cultural identity in town design.<ref name=\"postcolonial\"/>\n\n===Criticisms===\nCriticisms are well established regarding the implementation of the postcolonial vision of Nehru and Le Corbusier, and the critical emphasis on its influence. Claims have been made that the focus on Corbusier's architect-centred discourse erases the plural authorship of the narrative of Chandigarh's development, arguing that it was, in fact, hybridity of values and of \"contested modernities\" of Western and indigenous Indian origin and cultural exchanges rather than an uncontested administrative enterprise.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Perera |first1=Nihal |s2cid=220332059 |title=Contesting visions: hybridity, liminality, and authorship of the Chandigarh plan|journal=Planning Perspectives|volume=19|issue=2|pages=178|doi=10.1080/0266543042000192466|year=2004}}</ref> Such criticism is consistent with claims that decolonisation in India has marked a shift from segregation based on race to segregation based on class, and that planned cities are truly \"designed\" ones which represent the values and interests of a westernised middle-class Indian elite which ignore the complexities of India's diverse ethnic and cultural landscape and enabled neocolonial hierarchies such as the imposition of the Hindi language on non-conforming castes.<ref name=\"Making Chandigarh\"/><ref name=\"National Identity\"/><ref name=\"postcolonial\"/> Brent C.
