As a child, Mr Carver dreamt of being a Naval Air Pilot, but the Almighty had other plans as it may be a small loss to the forces, but a huge gain to the noble cause of education. Mr. Harold Carver, Principal, St. Stephen\u2019s School, Chandigarh runs through the annals of the history of the School  with inputs from the School\u2019s Additional Principal Mr. Richard Ellis,  and Ex Stephenian Gaurav Chhibber, MENTOR interweaves these interlocking blocks that have gone into the establishment of so esteemed an Institution.    \n\n\u201cSt. Stephen\u2019s school has been synonymous with ideals, which are pillars of education, namely discipline and integrity\u201d\n\nThere is a unique exuberance amongst the students and the teachers as they assemble for morning prayers in the huge quadrangular area of this magnificently built school. The prayers are said and all students and staff stand silently as if waiting for what might be essential to their day\u2019s working. A fleeting smile then crosses all faces as they see the one man they revere as their confidante and mentor-Mr. Harold Carver. For a man who commands such authority, he is one who strongly believes in virtues of humanity and generosity. Mr. Carver can easily be mistaken for someone from the world of celebrities than an educationist. His students feel he is both.\n\nChild of destiny:\n\nMr. Carver whose persona on stage has an unmatchable aura around it, recalls those early days when he went on stage for his first extempore. \u201cThe first time I went to speak on stage, the topic I was given was: \u2018Why  I like to study English?\u2019 When I saw my parents in the Auditorium I forgot everything and stood silent for what seemed ages.\u201d He shares this anecdote with all the young students who try emulating him in all ways possible. \u201cNever give up\u201d, he adds with a smile. True to these words, the Man has truly lived by them.\n\nAs a young lad I was fascinated by adventure and excitement.  I aspired to be a Naval Air Pilot. My dreams were however squashed when my father refused to sign the forms which would have made my childhood dream come true. For what then seemed to me as a cruel decision, in retrospect, seems like a decision made by the  Lord above . Thus, the favourite teacher of all his pupils became a teacher more out of destiny\u2019s works than his own choice. The grooming  of the educationist in Carver Sir is largely attributed   to his Mentors namely Mr Joseph Malikail, Director of Studies,  and Mr. T. A. Vyse, Principal  of  St. Thomas\u2019 Teacher\u2019s Training College Calcutta. As a teacher in St Joseph\u2019s Allahabad and then in  St. John\u2019s School, Chandigarh, Mr. Carver  was inspired by the Christian Brothers  to a great extent, and has led by example with the committed and devoted approach  that  students placed under his care have benefited from  immensely.\n\n\u201cA living legend, a great teacher, a best friend and lots more of such appellation are associated with him by his students\u201d\n\nDreams and reality:\n\nIn 1979 my father who was ill at that time, called me in one day to discuss what he considered was important. During the course of the conversation, I understood my father\u2019s dream of opening a school. Taken aback by this sudden expression of my father\u2019s dream, I simply told him that I was confident of being a good teacher but had my own doubts over my capabilities of being an administrator. In other words, I did not want to take the risk.  That was when my father said, \u201cYou don\u2019t know. I know. I have nurtured you as a son. So I know your capabilities as a son.\u201d  These words of inspiration grew to be a guiding factor all my life thereafter.  Soon after my father passed away, it was my mother who urged me to define my father\u2019s dream into a reality. By the time my mother returned from England, bookings for St. Stephen\u2019s had begun. The school which then had begun in a residential area with  students from various strata of the society. \n\nAgainst all Odds:\n\nIn 1991, the school shifted  to a 4 acre site in the southern sector of the city. The grand plans were however put a spanner into by a group of people in the management with vested interests. The group wanted to take over the school and turn it into a commercial institution compromising on the student friendly and educative ambience the school was now famous for. What followed then proved  beyond doubt the love of the students, teachers and parents  for Mr. Carver. For the first time probably in India students and staff struck work and declared a strike to ensure that Mr. Carver would not step down. On October 1, 1993, the day celebrated even today as Thanksgiving Day by all the students and teachers; Mr. Carver was reinstated as the rightful principal of St. Stephen\u2019s School, Chandigarh.\n\nAn enigmatic personality at times, Mr. Harold Carver has ushered  in many a novelty in the field of education that spans a period of over 43 years says Richard Ellis, Additional Principal at St. Stephen\u2019s. As goes the age old adage-\u201cRome was not built in a single day\u201d; so runs the chord of sentiments at St. Stephen\u2019s School, Chandigarh.  The School owes its very existence to the extreme resolution and grit that overcame many an impediment to being regarded today as one of the premier educational institutions.  The fact lies endorsed in the milestone of the School which is celebrating its  Silver Jubilee year; a glorious achievement that stands testimony to the making of the School.

The name translates from Hindi to English as \"the fort of Chandi\", [[Chandi]] being a Hindu Goddess.\n\nKnown internationally for its architecture and urban planning, Chandigarh is home to numerous architectural projects of [[Le Corbusier]], [[Pierre Jeanneret]], Matthew Nowicki, and Albert Mayer. The city boasts a high standard of living with the '''highest per capita income''' in the country and tops the list of [[Indian States]] and [[Union Territories]] with a [[Human Development Index]] of 0.674.<ref name=\"Times of India\">[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Chandigarhs_per_capita_income_highest_in_India/articleshow/3487128.cms Chandigarh's per capita income highest in India]</ref>\n\n== History ==\nAfter the [[Partition of India|partition]] of [[British India]] into the two nations of [[India]] and [[Pakistan]] in 1947, the region of Punjab was also split between India and Pakistan. The Indian state of Punjab required a new capital city to replace [[Lahore]], which became part of Pakistan during the partition. After several plans to make additions to existing cities were found to be infeasible for various reasons, the decision to construct a new and planned city was undertaken. The city derives its name from [[Chandi Mandir]], a temple of goddess ''[[Chandi]]'', located in nearby [[Panchkula District]] of Haryana. The word Chandigarh literally means \"the fort of Chandi\".\n\nOf all the new town schemes in independent India, the Chandigarh project quickly assumed prime significance, because of the city's strategic location as well as [[Jawaharlal Nehru]]'s (the first Prime Minister of independent India) personal interest in it. Commissioned by Nehru to reflect the new nation's modern, progressive outlook, Nehru famously proclaimed Chandigarh to be \"unfettered by the traditions of the past, a symbol of the nation's faith in the future.\" Several buildings and layouts in Chandigarh were designed by the [[Swiss]]-born [[France|French]] [[architect]] and [[urban planning|planner]], [[Le Corbusier]], in the 1950s. Le Corbusier was in fact the second architect of the city, after the initial master plan was prepared by the [[United States|American]] architect-planner [[Albert Mayer]] who was working with the [[Poland|Polish]]-born architect [[Matthew Nowicki]]. It was only after Nowicki's untimely death in 1950 that Le Corbusier was pulled into the project.\n\nOn [[1 November]], [[1966]], the newly-formed Indian state of [[Haryana]] was carved out of the eastern portion of the Punjab, in order to create Haryana as a majority [[Hindi]] speaking state, while the western portion of Punjab retained a mostly [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]]-speaking majority and remained as the current day [[Punjab (India)|Punjab]]. However, the city of Chandigarh was on the border, and was thus created into a [[union territory]] to serve as capital of both these states. Chandigarh was due to be transferred to Punjab in 1986, in accordance with an agreement signed in August 1985 by [[Rajiv Gandhi]], the Prime Minister of India at that time, with Sant Harchand Singh Longowal of the [[Akali Dal]]. This was to be accompanied by the creation of a new capital for Haryana, but the transfer has been delayed pending an agreement on which some villages in southern districts of Punjab, should be transferred to Haryana in exchange and Punjabi speaking parts of Haryana such as Jind, Sirsa, Fatehabad, Ambala etc. and Ganganagar of Rajasthan should be transferred to Punjab.\n\nOn [[15 July]] [[2007]], [[Chandigarh]] became the first Indian city to go smoke-free {{Fact|date=October 2007}}. Smoking at public places has been strictly prohibited and considered as a punishable act by Chandigarh Administration.\n\nThe other planned cities in India: [[Edwin Lutyens|Lutyen's]] [[New Delhi]], [[Bhubaneshwar]] in [[Orissa]], [[Gandhinagar]] in [[Gujrat]] and [[Navi Mumbai]] in [[Maharashtra]], were built close to existing old cities ([[Delhi]], [[Cuttack]], [[Ahmedabad]] and [[Mumbai]] respectively).\n\n== Geography ==\n[[Image:Chandigarh Lake.jpg|thumb|Sukhna Lake]]\nChandigarh is located near the foothills of the [[Shivaliks|Shivalik]] range of the [[Himalaya]]s in Northwest India. It covers an area of approximately 114 km\u00b2. and shares its borders with the states of Haryana in the south and Punjab in the north. The exact cartographic co-ordinates of Chandigarh are {{coor d|30.74|N|76.79|E|}}.<ref>[http://www.fallingrain.com/world/IN/5/Chandigarh.html Falling Rain Genomics, Inc - Chandigarh]</ref> It has an average elevation of 321 [[metre]]s (1053 [[foot (unit of length)|feet]]).\n\nThe surrounding districts are of Mohali, Patiala and Ropar in Punjab and Panchkula in Haryana. The boundary of the state of Himachal Pradesh are not too far from its north. Chandigarh has a sub-tropical continental monsoon climate characterized by a seasonal rhythm: hot summers, slightly cold winters, unreliable rainfall and great variation in temperature (-1 \u00b0C to 46.5 \u00b0C). In winter, frost sometimes occurs during December and January. The average annual rainfall is [http://chandigarh.nic.in/knowchd_general.htm 1110.7 mm]. The city also receives occasional winter rains from the west.\n\n''' Average temperature'''\n* '''Summer''': The temperature in summer may rise to a maximum of 46.5\u00b0C. Temperatures generally remain between 35\u00b0C to 42\u00b0C.\n* '''Autumn''': In autumn, the temperature may rise to a maximum of 36\u00b0C. Temperatures usually remain between 16\u00b0 to 27\u00b0 in autumn. The minimum temperature is around 13\u00b0C.\n* '''Winter''': Winters are quite cool and it can sometimes get quite chilly in Chandigarh. Average temperatures in winter (November to February) remain at (max) 7\u00b0C to 20 \u00b0C and (min) -2\u00b0C to 5\u00b0C.\n* '''Spring''': The climate remains quite pleasant during the spring season. Temperatures vary between (max) 16\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C and (min) 9\u00b0C to 18\u00b0C.\n\n{{climate chart\n|[[Chandigarh]]\n|6.1|20.4|33\n|8.3|23.1|39\n|13.4|28.4|30\n|18.9|34.5|9\n|23.1|38.3|28\n|25.4|38.6|145\n|23.9|34.0|280\n|23.3|32.7|308\n|21.8|33.1|133\n|17.0|31.8|22\n|10.5|27.3|9\n|6.7|22.1|22\n|source=[http://www.worldweather.org/066/c00526.htm World Weather Information Service]\n|float=centre\n|clear=none\n}}\n\n== Architecture and urban planning ==\n[[Image:Le Corbusier Map.jpg|thumb|[[Le Corbusier]]'s plan of modern Chandigarh]]\nTaking over from Albert Mayer, [[Le Corbusier]] produced a plan for Chandigarh that conformed to the [[modernism|modernist]] city planning principles of [[Congr\u00e8s International d'Architecture Moderne|CIAM]], in terms of division of urban functions, an [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] plan form, and a hierarchy of road and pedestrian networks.\n\nThis vision of Chandigarh, contained in the innumerable conceptual maps on the drawing board together with notes and sketches had to be translated into brick and mortar. Le Corbusier retained many of the seminal ideas of Mayer and Nowicki, like the basic framework of the master plan and its components: The Capitol, City Center, besides the University, Industrial area, and linear parkland. Even the neighborhood unit was retained as the basic module of planning. However, the curving outline of Mayer and Nowicki was reorganized into a mesh of rectangles, and the buildings were characterized by an \"honesty of materials\". Exposed brick and boulder stone masonry in its rough form produced unfinished concrete surfaces, in geometrical structures. This became the architectural form characteristic of Chandigarh, set amidst landscaped gardens and parks.\n\nThe initial plan had two phases: the first for a population of 150,000 and the second taking the total population to 500,000. Le Corbusier divided the city into units called \"sectors\", each representing a theoretically self-sufficient entity with space for living, working and leisure.  The sectors were linked to each other by a road and path network developed along the line of the 7 Vs, or a hierarchy of seven types of circulation patterns. At the highest point in this network was the V1, the highways connecting the city to others, and at the lowest were the V7s, the streets leading to individual houses.  Later a V8 was added: cycle and pedestrian paths.\n[[Image:Secretariat.jpg|thumb|350px|left|The Palace Assembly, designed by [[Le Corbusier]]]]\nThe city plan is laid down in a [[grid pattern]]. The whole city has been divided into rectangular patterns, forming identical looking sectors, each sector measures 800 m x 1200 m. The sectors were to act as self-sufficient neighbourhoods, each with its own market, places of worship, schools and colleges - all within 10 minutes walking distance from within the sector. The original two phases of the plan delineated sectors from 1 to 47, with the exception of 13 (Number 13 is considered unlucky). The Assembly, the secretariat and the high court, all located in Sector - 1 are the three monumental buildings designed by Le Corbusier in which he showcased his architectural genius to the maximum. The city was to be surrounded by a 16 kilometer wide [[greenbelt]] that was to ensure that no development could take place in the immediate vicinity of the town, thus checking suburbs and urban sprawl.\n\nWhile leaving the bulk of the city's architecture to other members of his team, Le Corbusier took responsibility for the overall master plan of the city, and the design of some of the major public buildings including the High Court, Assembly, Secretariat, the Museum and Art Gallery, School of Art and the Lake Club. Le Corbusier's most prominent building, the Court House, consists of the High court, which is literally higher than the other, eight lower courts. Most of the other housing was done by Le Corbusier's cousin [[Pierre Jeanneret]], the English husband and wife team of [[Maxwell Fry]] and [[Jane Drew]], along with a team of nine Indian architects -- M. N. Sharma, A. Ar. Prabhawalkar, B. P. Mathur, Piloo Moody, U. E. Chowdhury, N. S. Lamba, J. L. Malhotra, J. S. Dethe and [[Aditya Prakash]].\n\nThe city in its final form, while not resembling his previous city projects like the [[Ville Contemporaine]] or the [[Ville Radieuse]], was an important and iconic landmark in the history of town planning. It continues to be an object of interest for architects, planners, historians and social scientists. Chandigarh has two [[satellite]] cities: [[Panchkula]] and [[Mohali]]. Sometimes, the triangle of these three cities is collectively called the [[Chandigarh Tricity]].\n\n== Chandigarh UT Administration ==\n[[Image:India Chandigarh .jpg|thumb|The Open Hand, the official logo of Chandigarh]]\nChandigarh Administration is under the control of the Administrator who is appointed under the provisions of Art 239 of the Constitution. The administrative control of Chandigarh is under the Ministry of Home Affairs. The Governor of Punjab is the Administrator of Chandigarh. The ''Adviser to the Administrator'', a very senior officer belonging to one of the [[All India Services]], is second in command after the Administrator. He generally belongs to the AGMU cadre of the Indian Administrative Service.\n\n* The [[Deputy Commissioner (India)|Deputy Commissioner]], an officer belonging to the [[Indian Administrative Service]], is the in-charge of the General Administration in the Chandigarh UT.\n* The [[Superintendent of Police (India)|Senior Superintendent of Police]], an officer belonging to the [[Indian Police Service]], is responsible for maintaining Law & Order and related issues in the Chandigarh UT.\n* The [[Deputy Conservator of Forests (India)|Deputy Conservator of Forests]], an officer belonging to the [[Indian Forest Service]], is responsible for the management of the Forests, Environment, Wild-Life and Pollution Control in the Chandigarh UT.\n\nThe above three officers are from AGMU cadre or Punjab cadre or Haryana cadre of the [[All India Services]].\n\n== Demographics ==\n[[Image:Chandigarh Temple.jpg|right|thumb|Hindu Temple on the outskirts of the city]]\n[[As of 2001]] India [[census]],<ref>{{GR|India}}</ref> Chandigarh had a population of 900,635, making for a density of about 7900 persons per square kilometre. Males constitute 56% of the population and females 44%. The sex ratio is 777 females for every 1,000 males \u2013 which is the lowest in the country. Chandigarh has an average literacy rate of 81.9%, higher than the national average of 64.8%; with male literacy of 86.1% and female literacy of 76.5%. About 12% of the population is under 6 years of age. The main religions in Chandigarh are [[Hinduism]] (78.6%), [[Sikhism]] (16.1%), [[Islam]] (3.9%), and [[Christianity]] (0.8%).<ref>[http://censusindia.gov.in/Dist_File/datasheet-0401.pdf Indian Census]</ref> [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] and [[Hindi]] are the main languages spoken in Chandigarh, although these days [[English language|English]] has also gained some popularity. People speaking [[Tamil language|Tamil]] form the third biggest linguistic group in Chandigarh. (Census of India 1991). A small number of people also speak [[Urdu language|Urdu]]. However, the most common language for informal communication, especially among the youth of the city is a combination of Punjabi, Hindi and English.\n\nA significant percentage of the population of Chandigarh consists of people who had moved here from the neighboring states of Punjab and [[Haryana]] to fill up the large number of vacancies in various government departments that were established in Chandigarh.\n\n== Economy ==\nThe government is a major employer in Chandigarh with three governments having their base here. A significant percentage of Chandigarh\u2019s population therefore consists of people who are either working for one of these governments or have retired from government service. For this reason, Chandigarh is often called a \u201cPensioner's Paradise\u201d. There are about 15 medium to large industrial including two in the Public sector. In addition Chandigarh has over 2500 units are registered under small scale sector. The important industries are paper manufacturing, basic metals and alloys and machinery. Other industries are relating to food products, sanitary ware, auto parts, machine tools, pharmaceuticals and electrical appliances. Yet, with a [[Per Capita Income]] of Rs. 67,370, Chandigarh is the richest city in India.<ref>[http://www.ibnlive.com/news/chandigarhs-the-richest-of-em-all/12571-3.html Chandigarh's the richest of 'em all<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Chandigarh's gross state domestic product for 2004 is estimated at $2.2 billion in current prices.\n\nChandigarh has a well developed market and banking infrastructure. Nearly all the major banks in the country have registered their presence in Chandigarh. Most banks with a pan India presence have their zonal/regional offices present in Chandigarh. The Bank Square in [[Sector 17]] in Chandigarh has a large presence of such offices all in one section of the commercial sector.\n\nThree major trade promotion organizations have their offices in Chandigarh. These are: Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce & Industry, (FICCI) the PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry (PHDCCI) and the [[Confederation of Indian Industry]] (CII) which has its regional headquarters at Sector 31, Chandigarh.\n[[Image:IT Chandigarh.jpg|thumb|An IT Park in Chandigarh]]\nThe defence forces have a  significant presence in Chandigarh, apart from the [[Indian Airforce]] base in Sector 31 and the nearby Cantonment in [[Chandimandir]], the city is the base for sourcing supplies for the Leh Ladhak and Siachen region of defence operations.\n\nChandigarh IT Park (also Chandigarh Technology Park) is the city's attempt to break into the [[Information technology|IT]] world. Chandigarh's infrastructure, proximity to Delhi, Punjab and Haryana, and the IT talent pool attracts IT businesses looking for office space in the area. Major Indian firms and [[multinational corporation]]s including  [[Second Foundation (India) Pvt Ltd.

Auto-rickshaws are limited, and most often ply to and from the ISBT. Most heavy traffic roads now have rickshaw lanes, which the rickshaw-pullers must adhere to compulsorily.\n\nThe city also boasts of a well established network of modern radio cabs using cars like Tata indigo/Indigo Marina, [[Fiat Siena]] and Maruti Esteem.\n\nChandigarh is well connected by road. The two main National Highways (NH) connecting Chandigarh with the rest of the country are: NH 22 (Ambala - Kalka - Shimla - Kinnaur) and NH 21 (Chandigarh - Leh). Chandigarh has two Inter-State Bus Terminus (ISBT), one for the North, East and South located in Sector 17, which has regular bus services to most major cites in Haryana, [[Himachal Pradesh]], and [[Uttarakhand]], as well as the national capital [[Delhi]], which is about 240 km away. And a second in Sector 43 for the Western section, mainly Punjab, some parts of Himachal and Jammu and Kashmir.\n\nChandigarh has a railway station located about 10 km. away from the ISBT.
