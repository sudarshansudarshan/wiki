Most of the government buildings and houising in the city, however, is designed by the Chandigarh Capital Project Team headed by [[Pierre Jeanneret]], [[Jane Drew]] and [[Maxwell Fry]]. The original Indian members of the Capitol Project Team included M.N. Sharma, B.P. Mathur, J.L. Malhotra, U.E. Chowdhury, N.S. Lamba, J.S. Dethe, and [[Aditya Prakash (architect)|Aditya Prakash]].

The boundary of the state of [[Himachal Pradesh]] is also minutes away from its north border.\n\nChandigarh has a [[humid subtropical climate]] characterised by a seasonal rhythm: very hot summers, mild winters, unreliable rainfall and great variation in temperature (\u22121&nbsp;\u00b0C to 46&nbsp;\u00b0C). The average annual rainfall is [http://chandigarh.nic.in/knowchd_general.htm 1110.7 mm]. The city also receives occasional winter rains from the [[Western Disturbance]] originating over the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. Cold winds usually tend to come from the north near [[Shimla]], capital of Himanchal Pradesh and from the state of [[Jammu and Kashmir]], both of which receive their share of snowfall during wintertime.\n\n===Average temperature===\n\n*'''Spring''': The climate remains the most enjoyable part of the year during the spring season (from February-end to early-April). Temperatures vary between (max) 13&nbsp;\u00b0C to 20&nbsp;\u00b0C and (min) 5&nbsp;\u00b0C to 12&nbsp;\u00b0C.\n*'''Autumn''': In autumn (from September-end to mid November.), the temperature may rise to a maximum of 30&nbsp;\u00b0C. Temperatures usually remain between 10\u00b0 to 22\u00b0 in autumn. The minimum temperature is around 6&nbsp;\u00b0C.\n*'''Summer''': The temperature in summer (from Mid-April to June-end) may rise to a maximum of 40&nbsp;\u00b0C. Temperatures generally remain between 30&nbsp;\u00b0C to 39&nbsp;\u00b0C (94 \u2013 101F).\n*'''Monsoon''': During monsoon (from early-July to mid-September), Chandigarh receives moderate to heavy rainfall and sometimes heavy to very heavy rainfall (generally during the month of August or September). Usually, the rain bearing monsoon winds blow from south-west/south-east. Mostly, the city receives heavy rain from south (which is mainly a persistent rain) but it generally receives most of its rain during monsoon either from North-west or North-east. Maximum amount of rain received by the city of Chandigrah during monsoon season is 195.5&nbsp;mm in a single day.\n*'''Winter''': Winters (November-end to February-end) are mild but it can sometimes get quite chilly in Chandigarh. Average temperatures in the winter remain at (max) 5&nbsp;\u00b0C to 14&nbsp;\u00b0C and (min) -1&nbsp;\u00b0C to 5&nbsp;\u00b0C. Rain usually comes from the west during winters and it is usually a persistent rain for 2\u20133&nbsp;days with sometimes hail-storms.The city witnessed bone-numbing chill as the maximum temperature on Monday, 7 January 2013 plunged to a 30-year low to settle at 6.1 degrees Celsius.\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Chandigarh\n|metric first = Yes\n|single line = Yes\n|temperature colour = pastel\n|Jan high C = 16.4\n|Feb high C = 19.1\n|Mar high C = 24.5\n|Apr high C = 30.5\n|May high C = 35.4\n|Jun high C = 36.6\n|Jul high C = 30.0\n|Aug high C = 30.8\n|Sep high C = 29.1\n|Oct high C = 28.8\n|Nov high C = 23.3\n|Dec high C = 18.1\n|year high C =\n|Jan low C = 2.1\n|Feb low C = 4.3\n|Mar low C = 9.4\n|Apr low C = 14.9\n|May low C = 20.2\n|Jun low C = 22.4\n|Jul low C = 21.0\n|Aug low C = 20.3\n|Sep low C = 17.8\n|Oct low C = 13.0\n|Nov low C = 6.5\n|Dec low C = 2.7\n|year low C = \n| Jan rain mm  = 46.6\n| Feb rain mm  = 33.9\n| Mar rain mm  = 29.3\n| Apr rain mm  = 11.3\n| May rain mm  = 24.2\n| Jun rain mm  = 112.6\n| Jul rain mm  = 276.3\n| Aug rain mm  = 282.8\n| Sep rain mm  = 179.0\n| Oct rain mm  = 41.6\n| Nov rain mm  = 6.7\n| Dec rain mm  = 18.9\n| year rain mm = \n|Jan rain days= 3.8\n|Feb rain days= 3.9\n|Mar rain days= 2.6\n|Apr rain days= 2.4\n|May rain days= 2.5\n|Jun rain days= 7.1\n|Jul rain days= 12.9\n|Aug rain days= 13.3\n|Sep rain days= 6.1\n|Oct rain days= 1.9\n|Nov rain days= 1.3\n|Dec rain days= 1.9\n|source 1= World Meteorological Organisation<ref name=\"WMO\">[http://worldweather.wmo.int/066/c00526.htm World Weather Information Service-Chandigarh], World Meteorological Organisation.
