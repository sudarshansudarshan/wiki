However, the city does not belong to either state. Rather, the city is administered by the federal government and hence classified as a [[union territory]]. '''Chandigarh''' is also the name this union territory.\r\n\r\nChandigarh was a [[planned city]] until 1983, like [[Gandhinagar]], the capital of [[Gujarat]], until 1972.\r\n\r\nSeveral buildings in Chandigarh were designed by the Swiss [[architect]] [[Le Corbusier]] in the 1950s.\r\n\r\n''This article is a [[Wikipedia:Perfect stub article|stub]].
