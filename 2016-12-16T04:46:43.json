His site plan used natural characteristics, using its gentle grade to promote drainage and rivers to orient the plan. Mayer discontinued his work on Chandigarh after developing a master plan from the city when his architect-partner [[Matthew Nowicki]] died in a plane crash in 1950. Government officials recruited [[Le Corbusier]] to succeed Mayer and Nowicki, who enlisted many elements of Mayer's original plan without attributing them to him.\n\nLe Corbusier designed many administration buildings, including a courthouse, parliament building, and a university. He also designed the general layout of the city, dividing it into sectors. Chandigarh hosts the largest of Le Corbusier's many ''Open Hand'' sculptures, standing 26&nbsp;metres high. ''[[Open Hand Monument|The Open Hand (La Main Ouverte)]]'' is a recurring motif in Le Corbusier's architecture, a sign for him of \"peace and reconciliation.

The average annual rainfall is [http://chandigarh.nic.in/knowchd_general.htm 1110.7 mm]. The city also receives occasional winter rains from the [[Western Disturbance]] originating over the [[Mediterranean Sea]].\n\nThe western disturbances usually brings rain predominantly from mid-December till end of April which can be heavier sometimes with strong winds and hails if the weather turns colder (during March\u2013April months) which usually proves disastrous to the crops. Cold winds usually tend to come from the north near [[Shimla]], capital of [[Himachal Pradesh]] and from the state of [[Jammu and Kashmir]], both of which receive their share of snowfall during wintertime.\n\nThe city experiences the following seasons and the respective average temperatures:\n\n*'''Spring''': The climate remains the most enjoyable part of the year during the spring season (from February-end to early-April). Temperatures vary between (max) 13&nbsp;\u00b0C to 20&nbsp;\u00b0C and (min) 5&nbsp;\u00b0C to 12&nbsp;\u00b0C.\n*'''Autumn''': In autumn (from September-end to mid November.), the temperature may rise to a maximum of 30&nbsp;\u00b0C. Temperatures usually remain between 10\u00b0 to 22\u00b0 in autumn. The minimum temperature is around 6&nbsp;\u00b0C.\n*'''Summer''': The temperature in summer (from Mid-April to June-end) may rise to 44&nbsp;\u00b0C. The temperatures might sometime rise to 44&nbsp;\u00b0C in mid-June. Temperatures generally vary between 40 and 42&nbsp;\u00b0C. \n*'''Monsoon''': During monsoon (from early-July to mid-September), Chandigarh receives moderate to heavy rainfall and sometimes heavy to very heavy rainfall (generally during the month of August or September). Usually, the rain bearing monsoon winds blow from south-west/south-east. Mostly, the city receives heavy rain from south (which is mainly a persistent rain) but it generally receives most of its rain during monsoon either from North-west or North-east. Maximum amount of rain received by the city of Chandigarh during monsoon season is 195.5&nbsp;mm in a single day.\n*'''Winter''': Winters (November-end to February-end) are mild but it can sometimes get quite chilly in Chandigarh. Average temperatures in the winter remain at (max) 5&nbsp;\u00b0C to 14&nbsp;\u00b0C and (min) -1&nbsp;\u00b0C to 5&nbsp;\u00b0C. Rain usually comes from the west during winters and it is usually a persistent rain for 2\u20133&nbsp;days with sometimes hailstorms.
