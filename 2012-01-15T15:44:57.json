Of all the [[new town]] schemes in independent India, the Chandigarh project quickly assumed prime significance, because of the city's strategic location as well as the personal interest of [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], the first [[Prime Minister]] of independent India. Commissioned by [[Nehru]] to reflect the new nation's modern, progressive outlook, Chandigarh was designed by the French (born Swiss) architect and urban planner, [[Le Corbusier]], in the 1950s. Le Corbusier was in fact the second architect of the city, after the initial master plan was prepared by the [[United States|American]] architect-planner Albert Mayer who was working with the Polish-born architect [[Matthew Nowicki]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\nOn 1 November 1966, the newly-formed Indian state of [[Haryana]] was carved out of the eastern portion of the Punjab, in order to create [[Haryana]] as a majority [[Hindi]]-speaking state (with a [[Hindu]] majority), while the western portion of Punjab retained a mostly [[Punjabi language]]-speaking majority (with a [[Sikh]] majority) and remained as the current day [[Punjab, India|federated state of Punjab]]. However, the city of Chandigarh was on the border, and was thus created into a [[union territory]] to serve as capital of both these states.<ref>http://www.haryana-online.com/History/history_1966-.htm</ref>\n\n==Geography and climate==\n\n[[Image:Chandigarh Lake.jpg|right|thumb|Sukhna Lake]]\nChandigarh is located near the foothills of the [[Shivaliks|Shivalik]] range of the [[Himalaya]]s in northwest India. It covers an area of approximately 44.5 sq&nbsp;mi or 114&nbsp;km\u00b2. and shares its borders with the states of Haryana in the east and Punjab in the north, west and south. The exact cartographic co-ordinates of Chandigarh are {{Coord|30.74|N|76.79|E|}}.<ref>[http://www.fallingrain.com/world/IN/5/Chandigarh.html Falling Rain Genomics, Inc - Chandigarh]</ref> It has an average elevation of 321 metres (1053&nbsp;ft).\n\n{{climate chart\n|Chandigarh\n|6.1|20.4|33\n|8.3|23.1|39\n|13.4|28.4|30\n|18.9|34.5|9\n|23.1|38.3|28\n|25.4|38.6|145\n|23.9|34.0|280\n|23.3|32.7|308\n|21.8|33.1|133\n|17.0|31.8|22\n|10.5|27.3|9\n|6.7|22.1|22\n|source=[http://www.worldweather.org/066/c00526.htm World Weather Information Service]\n|float=right\n|clear=\n}}\n\nThe surrounding districts are of [[Mohali]], [[Patiala]] and [[Roopnagar]] in Punjab and [[Panchkula]] and [[Ambala]] in Haryana. The boundary of the state of [[Himachal Pradesh]] is also minutes away from its north border.\n\nChandigarh has a [[humid subtropical climate]] characterized by a seasonal rhythm: very hot summers, mild winters, unreliable rainfall and great variation in temperature (-1 \u00b0C to 41.2 \u00b0C). In winter, pieces of snow sometimes occurs during December and January. The average annual rainfall is [http://chandigarh.nic.in/knowchd_general.htm 1110.7 mm]. The city also receives occasional winter rains from the west.\n\n=== Average temperature ===\n\n* '''Spring''': The climate remains quite pleasant during the spring season (from mid-February to mid-March and then from mid-September to mid-October). Temperatures vary between (max) 16 \u00b0C to 25 \u00b0C and (min) 9 \u00b0C to 18 \u00b0C.\n* '''Autumn''': In autumn (from Mid-March to April), the temperature may rise to a maximum of 36 \u00b0C. Temperatures usually remain between 16\u00b0 to 27\u00b0 in autumn. The minimum temperature is around 11 \u00b0C.\n* '''Summer''': The temperature in summer (from Mid-May to Mid-June) may rise to a maximum of 45 \u00b0C (rarely). Temperatures generally remain between 35 \u00b0C to 40 \u00b0C (94 - 101F).\n* '''Monsoon''': During monsoon(from mid-June to mid-September), Chandigarh receives moderate to heavy rainfall and sometimes heavy to very heavy rainfall (generally during the month of August or September). Usually, the rain bearing monsoon winds blow from south-west/ south-east. Mostly, the city receives heavy rain from south (which is mainly a persistent rain) but it generally receives most of its rain during monsoon either from North-west or North-east. Maximum amount of rain received by the city of Chandigrah during monsoon season is 195.5&nbsp;mm in a single day.\n* '''Winter''': Winters (November to Mid-March) are mild but it can sometimes get quite chilly in Chandigarh. Average temperatures in the winter remain at (max) 7 \u00b0C to 15 \u00b0C and (min) 0\u00b0C to 8 \u00b0C. Rain usually comes from the west during winters and it is usually a persistent rain for 2\u20133 days with sometimes hail-storms.\n\n==Environment==\nMost of Chandigarh is covered by dense [[Banyan]] and [[Eucalyptus]] plantations. [[Ashoka tree|Asoka]], [[Cassia Fistula|Cassia]], [[Mulberry]] and other trees flourish in the forested ecosystem.The city has forests surrounding it which sustain many animal and plant species. [[Deer]]s, [[Sambar (deer)|Sambar]]s, [[Barking Deer]]s, [[Parrot]]s, [[Woodpecker]]s and [[Peacock]]s inhabit the protected forests. [[Sukhna Lake]] hosts a variety of ducks and geese, and attracts migratory birds from parts of Siberia and Japan in the winter season.\n\nA parrot sanctuary located in the city is home to a variety of bird species.\n\n==Architecture and urban planning==\n[[File:Assembly 09.jpg|thumb|left|Legislative Assembly by [[Le Corbusier]]]]\nTaking over from Albert Mayer, Le Corbusier produced a plan for Chandigarh that conformed to the modern city planning principles of [[Congr\u00e8s International d'Architecture Moderne]] CIAM, in terms of division of urban functions, an anthropomorphic plan form, and a hierarchy of road and pedestrian networks.\nThis vision of Chandigarh, contained in the innumerable conceptual maps on the drawing board together with notes and sketches had to be translated into brick and mortar. Le Corbusier retained many of the seminal ideas of Mayer and Nowicki, like the basic framework of the master plan and its components: The Capitol, City Center, besides the University, Industrial area, and linear parkland. Even the neighborhood unit was retained as the basic module of planning. However, the curving outline of Mayer and Nowicki was reorganized into a mesh of rectangles, and the buildings were characterized by an \"honesty of materials\". Exposed brick and boulder stone masonry in its rough form produced unfinished concrete surfaces, in geometrical structures. This became the architectural form characteristic of Chandigarh, set amidst landscaped gardens and parks.\n\n[[Chandigarh Museum and Art gallery]] have a separate section dedicated to the architecture of Chandigarh.\n\n==Chandigarh administration==\nChandigarh Administration is under the control of the Administrator who is appointed under the provisions of Article 239 of the Constitution.{{clarify|reason=whose constitution?

A significant percentage of Chandigarh\u2019s population therefore consists of people who are either working for one of these governments or have retired from government service. For this reason, Chandigarh is often called a \u201cPensioner's Paradise\u201d. There are about 15 medium to large industries including two in the Public sector. In addition Chandigarh has over 2500 units registered under small scale sector. The important industries are paper manufacturing, basic metals and alloys and machinery.
