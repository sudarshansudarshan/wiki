The name translates from Hindi to English as \"the fort of Chandi\", [[Chandi]] being a Hindu Goddess.\n\nKnown internationally for its architecture and urban planning, Chandigarh is home to numerous architectural projects of [[Le Corbusier]], [[Pierre Jeanneret]], Matthew Nowicki, and Albert Mayer. The city boasts a high standard of living with the highest per capita income in the country and tops the list of [[Indian States]] and [[Union Territories]] with a [[Human Development Index]] of 0.987.<ref name=\"Times of India\"> http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Chandigarhs_per_capita_income_highest_in_India/articleshow/3487128.cms Chandigarh's per capita income highest in India]</ref>\n\n== History ==\nAfter the [[Partition of India|partition]] of [[British India]] into the two nations of [[India]] and [[Pakistan]] in 1947, the region of Punjab was also split between India and Pakistan. The Indian state of Punjab required a new capital city to replace [[Lahore]], which became part of Pakistan during the partition. After several plans to make additions to existing cities were found to be infeasible for various reasons, the decision to construct a new and planned city was undertaken. The city derives its name from [[Chandi Mandir]], a temple of goddess ''[[Chandi]]'', located in nearby [[Panchkula District]] of Haryana. The word Chandigarh literally means \"the fort of Chandi\".{{Fact|date=September 2008}}\n\nOf all the new town schemes in independent India, the Chandigarh project quickly assumed prime significance, because of the city's strategic location as well as [[Jawaharlal Nehru]]'s (the first Prime Minister of independent India) personal interest in it. Commissioned by Nehru to reflect the new nation's modern, progressive outlook, Nehru famously proclaimed Chandigarh to be \"unfettered by the traditions of the past, a symbol of the nation's faith in the future.\" Several buildings and layouts in Chandigarh were designed by the [[Swiss]]-born [[France|French]] [[architect]] and [[urban planning|planner]], [[Le Corbusier]], in the 1950s. Le Corbusier was in fact the second architect of the city, after the initial master plan was prepared by the [[United States|American]] architect-planner [[Albert Mayer]] who was working with the [[Poland|Polish]]-born architect [[Matthew Nowicki]]. It was only after Nowicki's untimely death in 1950 that Le Corbusier was pulled into the project.{{Fact|date=September 2008}}\n\nOn [[1 November]], [[1966]], the newly-formed Indian state of [[Haryana]] was carved out of the eastern portion of the Punjab, in order to create Haryana as a majority [[Hindi]] speaking state, while the western portion of Punjab retained a mostly [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]]-speaking majority and remained as the current day [[Punjab (India)|Punjab]]. However, the city of Chandigarh was on the border, and was thus created into a [[union territory]] to serve as capital of both these states. Chandigarh was due to be transferred to Punjab in 1986, in accordance with an agreement signed in August 1985 by [[Rajiv Gandhi]], the Prime Minister of India at that time, with Sant Harchand Singh Longowal of the [[Akali Dal]]. This was to be accompanied by the creation of a new capital for Haryana, but the transfer has been delayed pending an agreement on which some villages in southern districts of Punjab, should be transferred to Haryana in exchange and Punjabi speaking parts of Haryana such as [[Jind]], [[Sirsa]], [[Fatehabad]], [[Ambala]] etc. and Ganganagar of Rajasthan should be transferred to Punjab.{{Fact|date=September 2008}}\n\nOn [[15 July]] [[2007]], [[Chandigarh]] became the first Indian city to go smoke-free {{Fact|date=October 2007}}. Smoking at public places has been strictly prohibited and considered as a punishable act by Chandigarh Administration. That was followed up by a complete ban on polythene bags with effect from [[2 October]] [[2008]], the birthday of the [[Father of the Nation]].\n\nThe other planned cities in India: [[New Delhi]], [[Bhubaneshwar]] in [[Orissa]], [[Gandhinagar]] in [[Gujarat]] and [[Navi Mumbai]] in [[Maharashtra]], were built close to existing old cities ([[Delhi]], [[Cuttack]], [[Ahmedabad]] and [[Mumbai]] respectively).{{Fact|date=September 2008}}\n\n== Geography ==\n[[Image:Chandigarh Lake.jpg|thumb|Sukhna Lake]]\nChandigarh is located near the foothills of the [[Shivaliks|Shivalik]] range of the [[Himalaya]]s in Northwest India. It covers an area of approximately 44 [[square mile|sq&nbsp;mi]] or 114 [[km\u00b2]]. and shares its borders with the states of Haryana in the south and Punjab in the north. The exact cartographic co-ordinates of Chandigarh are {{coord|30.74|N|76.79|E|}}.<ref>[http://www.fallingrain.com/world/IN/5/Chandigarh.html Falling Rain Genomics, Inc - Chandigarh]</ref> It has an average elevation of 321 [[metre]]s (1053 [[foot (unit of length)|feet]]).\n\nThe surrounding districts are of Mohali, Patiala and Ropar in Punjab and Panchkula and Ambala in Haryana. The boundary of the state of Himachal Pradesh are not too far from its north. Chandigarh has a sub-tropical continental monsoon climate characterized by a seasonal rhythm: hot summers, slightly cold winters, unreliable rainfall and great variation in temperature (-1 \u00b0C to 41.2 \u00b0C). In winter, frost sometimes occurs during December and January. The average annual rainfall is [http://chandigarh.nic.in/knowchd_general.htm 1110.7 mm]. The city also receives occasional winter rains from the west.\n\n''' Average temperature'''\n* '''Summer''': The temperature in summer (from Mid-May to Mid-June) may rise to a maximum of 46.5\u00b0C (rarely).

Usually, the rain bearing monsoon winds blow from south-west/ south-east. Mostly, the city receives heavy rain from south (which is mainly a persistent rain) but it generally receives most of its rain during monsoon either from North-west or North-east. Maximum amount of rain received by the city of Chandigrah during monsoon season is 195.5 mm in a single day.\n* '''Autumn''': In autumn (from Mid-March to April), the temperature may rise to a maximum of 36\u00b0C. Temperatures usually remain between 16\u00b0 to 27\u00b0 in autumn. The minimum temperature is around 13\u00b0C.\n* '''Winter''': Winters (November to Mid-March) are quite cool and it can sometimes get quite chilly in Chandigarh. Average temperatures in winter remain at (max) 7\u00b0C to 15 \u00b0C and (min) -2\u00b0C to 5\u00b0C. Rain usually comes from the west duirng winters and it is usually a persistent rain for 2-3 days with sometimes hail-storms.\n* '''Spring''': The climate remains quite pleasant during the spring season (from mid-February to mid-March and then from mid-September to mid-October). Temperatures vary between (max) 16\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C and (min) 9\u00b0C to 18\u00b0C.\n\n{{climate chart\n|[[Chandigarh]]\n|6.1|20.4|33\n|8.3|23.1|39\n|13.4|28.4|30\n|18.9|34.5|9\n|23.1|38.3|28\n|25.4|38.6|145\n|23.9|34.0|280\n|23.3|32.7|308\n|21.8|33.1|133\n|17.0|31.8|22\n|10.5|27.3|9\n|6.7|22.1|22\n|source=[http://www.worldweather.org/066/c00526.htm World Weather Information Service]\n|float=centre\n|clear=none\n}}\n\n== Architecture and urban planning ==\n[[Image:Le Corbusier Map.jpg|thumb|[[Le Corbusier]]'s plan of modern Chandigarh]]\nTaking over from Albert Mayer, [[Le Corbusier]] produced a plan for Chandigarh that conformed to the [[modernism|modernist]] city planning principles of [[Congr\u00e8s International d'Architecture Moderne|CIAM]], in terms of division of urban functions, an [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] plan form, and a hierarchy of road and pedestrian networks.\n\nThis vision of Chandigarh, contained in the innumerable conceptual maps on the drawing board together with notes and sketches had to be translated into brick and mortar. Le Corbusier retained many of the seminal ideas of Mayer and Nowicki, like the basic framework of the master plan and its components: The Capitol, City Center, besides the University, Industrial area, and linear parkland. ftyrrutyutyuty[[Image:Punjab Bus.jpg|thumb|Punbus connects the city to other parts of [[Punjab (India)|Punjab]]]]\nChandigarh has the largest number of vehicles per capita.<ref>http://www.deccanherald.com/deccanherald/jun132006/national181232006612.asp</ref> Wide, well maintained roads and ample parking space all over the city, make it convenient to use private vehicles for local transport.\n\nPublic buses run by the Chandigarh Transport Undertaking (CTU), an undertaking of the Chandigarh Administration, provide local transport as well as inter-state transport services.<ref>[http://www.citcochandigarh.com/how_to_reach/index.php CITCO<!-- Bot generated title -->]</reutyuf>\n\nThe Chandigarh Traffic Police oversees the implementation of the traffic rules, and is widely credited for a fairly orderly traffic system.
